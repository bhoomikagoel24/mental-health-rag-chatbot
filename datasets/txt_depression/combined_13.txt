hey guy im gon na be honest here im a year old stoner with a lot of mental health issue i havent ever really had anyone i felt comfortable or safe opening up to and i know it can be the same for a lot of other men of all age i wanted to create a subreddit of some sort a a safe place to vent give and seek advice for domestic or any other reason a men mental health problem seems to be kinda looked over i m looking for advice on how to grow that kind of community i haven t had a safe place like that for me and i dont want men to have the same problem or feel the same way i would eventually like to grow this in to a full fledged non profit organisation kindest regard safewithus

so four year ago i met this guy online we hung out quite a bit from october 0 until may 0 9 we hung out almost every single day so in a nutshell he had a problem with drug and mental health issue and went to jail in june 0 9 he ended up being sentenced to three year in a mental hospital from online court record i knew he wa getting released this month about two week ago i looked at his facebook and he had like 0 more friend than the last time i looked i also noticed he had commented on someone s status anyway he posted his new number on there a couple day ago i thought about texting him but i don t know if i should i would really like to see him again but my sister is telling me to stay away from him i m not friend with him on facebook i only knew the guy for a year so maybe he won t even remember me what do you think

i emailed my teacher a few week ago because we had a speech coming up so i emailed her ahead of time i explained that i have an anxiety disorder gad and that speaking in front of a class is not something i am able to do because of really bad anxiety attack and also i lose the ability to speak so yeah i asked if there wa any way i could still get point without having to do the speech in front of the class she asked if we could do it just u together a in i present it to just her at lunch i agreed but now i regret it my speech is tomorrow and i m freaking out even over just saying my speech to just her i don t think i can do it but it would look bad if i email her saying i ll just take the zero instead right

i know my mind think thing that make no sense and sometimes i just sit there and watch myself experience these thought and then i fall into a weird psychosis i keep having irrational fear of death and it trigger me on a daily basis i get scared to fall asleep because i think my dad is going to murder me i sit in the car and get a random thought about getting hit and dying i watch the news and get scared about another war starting that lead to dying the anxiety that i have about dying before i am able to get old ruin my willingness to actually enjoy my life i think the past couple of year since covid ha exposed me to a lot of unexpected and very triggering event in my life and for this reason i m scared to relax when thing are going good i worry about enjoying peace in my life because something bad might happen so much of this worrying make me sleep a lot it make me frustrated about myself it take away the motivation and lust i used to have for life i am too familiar with a rising heartbeat every thirty minute or the feeling of dread after doing the most mundane thing sometimes i walk around in my everyday life and just feel like i m in a developing video game and i m just waiting for the program to start i m scared all of the time of what the next thing that s going to happen to me come i wish i could be a normal person i remember when my anxiety used to just revolve around small stuff like my appearance now i don t even care about what i look like it s like i don t even recognize who i am anymore

i m not sure if i have anxiety or adhd or im just introverted and procrastinating lol i started biting my nail since i wa a kid i tried hard to get rid of this habit but it not something i can control i put on nail polish usually but once it fall ill start biting them or fixing them with nail clipper a little bit of unsmoothness on my nail will bother me a lot and ill just sit there and keep fixing it for hour straight instead of doing any work literally every 0 min i would find somewhere bothering me on my nail i also overthink a lot it might be influenced by my mom who kept telling me that others might think negatively about me bc of any barely noticeable detail about what i do how i look so now i will just replay some scenario in my head hundred of time feel bad about myself and had to take deep breath say to myself it ok out loud or make some sudden noise to make my mind jump out of that vicious loop recently i feel that my attention span is getting even shorter i will sit down for work and get distracted after min and start watching youtube video for hour i notice myself doing that and i would think maybe i should go back to work but the other part of my mind is like numb and fail to take any action to the point that im only able to focus for a long time under pressure like a day before meeting or exam idk if it is just bad work ethic procrastination introversion or i should get a check up for anxiety adhd like i heard other ppl relate to me on point amp so idk if it just some common problem that i can just work it out either way can anyone give me any advice on whether to get a diagnosis or smth i could do on my own to mitigate these behavior thanks

finally decided to give it a try wish me luck

i ve always had anxiety issue a a kid i thought that i wa normal and everyone felt this way dry heaving in the car on the way to a new babysitter house i m now and i still have constant anxiety the last three month have been worse than anything prior the only time i feel slightly normal is when i take a xanax my dr said that they re addictive so it s a short term solution i have been off of work on and off for two month my dr gave me zoloft and i ve been on it for a week and a half and i m still somewhat hopeful that it ll kick in but idk what i ll do if it doesn t help substantially

just to start off i do work but i really don t want to for some reason i get a crazy amount of dread when thinking about working especially going into a shift i especially have anxiety thinking about how it mess with my schedule i had a really bad experience with a lazy employer and i would work totally alone for shift without much instruction it wasn t very bad but my anxiety would not leave me alone it keep me up at night and that s really hard to do because i fall asleep in literal second i don t even know where to go from here everyone i tell this to say i have to work a if i will never get a job for this reason even when i specifically say i will work but i won t like it

i m trying to figure out if this is an anxiety thing i have been thinking that i may have adhd and i know this is a symptom of it but my therapist say that she won t test me for it bc anxiety can mimick adhd i go through these period every few week or some time every few day i m either really motivated and will do a million thing in a day and clean shower hang out w friend everyday but if this go on for too long i get extremely depressed and burnt out this happened friday i wa so motivated i went to work then the gym then cleaned then saturday i wa out all day something not normal for me sunday wa the same i worked then went out w friend spent all day with friend monday and tuesday worked then went to the gym but now i m extremely depressed and my room is so messy and i don t have any energy and just want to lay in bed for day and not talk to anyone i thought this wa an anxiety v depression cycle but now i think it s sort of a manic like v depression burn out cycle i m just looking to see if anyone can relate it s so hard to keep a job bc of these period of burn out no matter what stage i am in the cycle i m still extremely anxious i just have more motivation to push through it when i m at that point in the cycle

anyone else with this fear i can t go outside when it s dark i get panic attack thinking everyone is out to get me i also have a fear of getting killed by previous boyfriend friend and fear they will break into my house it make it hard to look into the future thinking everyday is the last

so i literally have barely any success in making friend i make friend we get close then they disappear from my life i m in uni now trying to make friend i have a small nice friend group i get invited to some of the hangout etc but i constantly feel like there is tension between me and a few people like a if they hate me i made a friend last year now she barely talk to me and i genuinely think she hate me to add i m not a sexual person at all so i never made advance with any of those friend if anything i try to avoid physical contact because of constant anxiety of making people uncomfortable i also have low self esteem which is pretty clear but i really feel sad about having people not like me i mean some people always get text and are friend with so many people eventhough theyre barely more social than i am i genuinely don t understand my problem amp x 00b tldr how to make people like you a a friend how to stop thinking everyone hate you

how do i quit a job i keep having panic attack and it s interfering with my job i just started two week ago and this is happening someone plz help i missed my alarm this morning and it s a bad look i don t know what to tect my bos i m quitting bc i feel nervous everyday about the job it s sad bc i actually liked it it s my body that s the issue

i have an interview tomorrow and i feel like i am dying from how stressed i am right now i already had a panic attack earlier but thankfully i came down from it fast this would be my second job ever and i wa at my first job for three year so i feel like i will be rusty and mess it up and i have to drive a route i am not used to and dont know well which driving is a major trigger for me can i have some word of support or encouragement to get through this please

i found out today i ll most likely lose my job tomorrow i am a covid suppression specialist and of course i knew there would come a time but based on what the leader had said i expected to stay on until next summer i m doing my best to distract myself but i m feeling my anxiety in my leg and arm it s almost like that feeling you get after your foot fall asleep i ve managed to lose lb in the last week about 0 more to go and i don t want to stress eat and gain it back

is it a bad thing i cried in front of my friend who s a girl so i m a guy and my best friend who is a girl opened up to me about abuse she faced in the past and i started cry while she wa telling me and i just hugged her the next day i told opened up to her that i experienced the same type of abuse and that s why it broke my heart when she had told me about it i also have opened up to her about me self harming and having severe depression and having a drug problem i ve recently been doing better but i can t help but worry that this changed how she see me she ha remained super supportive and still asks me to hangout and i feel like we have grown closer but i also worry she secretly think i m a bitch now

so i wa prescribed propranolol 0mg for really bad physical anxiety symptom i have something coming up later in the semester in term of presentation it s not just presentation it s like presentation in one day i know what a joy i wa definitely planning to take a dose that day however i m scared it will wear off a few hour later is it fine if i double the dos that day or should i not

i love alcohol no i m not a problem drinker but i love a good hazy ipa a good single malt scotch and good wine but when i m having an extended bout of anxiety head fog i completely lose my desire for any of it is that odd

so i ve always feared going crazy a few day ago someone made fun of a stutter in front of me cause they didn t know i stuttered after that realized how easy it is for others to talk badly behind my back and wondered who can i really trust i realized a few day later anyone can be made fun of for many thing and i m no different rather if it s a stutter lisp religion sexuality appearance you can be made fun of it for all of that i stopped worry about it and later in the day someone commented on a post about it and said they became psychotic and paranoid thinking about people talking behind their back after they did that for a long period of time this freaked me out because this thought wasn t from ocd although later that first day i thought this i thought i feel crazy thinking this way it took 0 0 minute after reading that comment to not feel like i wa about to have a panic attack and ever since that happened yesterday i ve been extremely anxious i wa laying in bed and realized 99 of people won t make fun of me and the one that do i ll never be friend with and if i am they ll show themselves with time but i wa laying in bed and it feel like a weight wa lifted off of me i realized it s best to take this stutter le serious i ve been letting it defy me instead of treating it like an aspect of me i wa thinking about it i stuttered during sex and literally started laughing because i found it funny and i remembered my cousin making fun of my stutter when i said pork i stuttered and she said ah yes i love pork pork pork i wa offended at the time but i find it funny now i m learning there s joke that devalue me and joke that are lightheaded and i m beginning to not be offended at the light hearted joke now that i see that difference i heard people before going insane end up really happy sometimes and i feel great now that i realized i m going to take it le serious and just joke about my stutter because it doesn t define me doe it sound like i m going insane or did i just figure out what i needed to do after becoming scared but turning that into a plus for me

doe anyone else experience this i had a very traumatic fainting experience when i wa 0 year old and have fainted maybe 0 or so time in the last year following it normally is brought on by extreme anxiety and trigger would love to know if anyone ha any tip with dealing with this at this point i can kind of know what s going to cause a fainting spell but it s very exhausting to always have to think about

i ve had tinnitus for like year could it be somehow related to anxiety also neck pain for year tension mainly thanks for answer

last night i had a dream that ha been weighing on my mind all day long even now a i prepare for bed i cant shake the memory of it and i fear that it will be revisited in more horrible way than before the love of my life stephanie is traveling home with two of her male friend from a party their car is forced off the road by a pair of car and armed men jump out and pull them from their vehicle the friend are brutally executed with a hail of gunfire and stephanie covered in their sticky blood is forced into the trunk of one of their car pleading with the men she is taken to a dark place and sold a an object and she becomes the victim of human trafficking for 0 year i pine for my lost love a i wonder about her disappearance and out of the blue i learn of her fate and also her whereabouts i go to the gun store she is being held in and spy her in a back room chained inside a cage her form battered and bedraggled and only a sliver of her once beautiful form remaining i make pleasantry with the men behind the counter a i surreptitiously draw from my pocket a blade asking for the price of an item on the shelf behind him i draw the attention of one of the men away from me making him turn around when his back is turned i take my knife and swiftly slit his throat throwing his gagging body to the floor with shocked look on their face the other two men in the store watch a i bound over the counter and stab the first of them to death through his chest with a leap across the room i take hold of the last of them and we struggle furiously a he force the blade from my hand causing it to clatter to the floor we fight ferociously and eventually i best my foe caving in his skull with a piece of furniture and pulling the cage key from his pocket covered head to toe in gore i unlock stephanie s cage and help her to freedom she look at me like i m some fresh hell being visited on her but i reveal myself for who i am and tell her that she is rescued she burst into tear of relief and sob for hour over all the horrible thing she ha been forced to do and to witness for year nearly uncounted and i console her until she is calmed i produce for her a pair of cupcake that i had prepared before entering the store and had set aside i tell her that the first is made of sugar and apple and is all the sweet thing i will give to her the second is made of coffee and rat poison and will taste bitter but will be the end of her suffering at long last i give her the choice and without a moment hesitation she take the latter and eats heartily of it sending the former to the floor forgotten she smile a wan grin at me and tell me thank you before closing her eye and looking finally at peace with her lot i hold her in my arm to keep her warm and safe a she pass on into the next world unable to live with what ha happened to her in her captivity at this point i awoke and stared at the pillow beneath me and imagined all the terrible thing that stephanie must have experienced and for a long moment i wa horrified it wa only then that the realization that it wa a dream hit me and i remembered the truth stephanie ha been dead for fifteen year she took her own life in a fit of depression and did not in fact fall victim to human trafficking at this realization i said aloud i m glad you killed yourself with an unspoken underscore of this realization that she hadn t been sold a thought that in no way ha ever formed in my mind or lip before that moment writing out this account already make me feel better and i think i might be able to brave another round of unconsciousness though i have no doubt another mare of the night will visit this is my first reddit posting and i thank you for reading it

hello all lately i have been fighting with my anxiety after having fought in a relationship i m still holding pain in my chest and i always wake up with anxiety also i always cry during the day and before going to sleep i m living with my boyfriend and i don t want him to be sad like me amp x 00b could you guy give me some advice to help me heal myself

sometimes it s not even mental anxiety somedays i just feel it physically i can be totally okay in the noggin but my muscle are tense i m really cold my leg can t stop bouncing my jaw is clenching my nail are digging into my palm then i get up and the world feel woozy that s when i realize how exhausted i am despite hardly doing anything that could ve caused that exhaustion no anxious thought just an anxious body

i have this constant thought hanging over my head that at all time somehow i m not using my time wisely regardless of what it is if i m taking a relaxing bath to calm my nerve i think about how i could be doing something even more fun or exciting and this task is not worth the time i m spending on it i often have morning where i find myself unable to fall back asleep even if i m awake way earlier than i need to be for work plan that day lamenting how i am or am not using that time to my best advantage it make it so hard to enjoy my day off or the time i don t spend occupied with something sometimes my day off are stressful the most at the very end when i reflect back on all the thing i didn t do but should have done even if that s total nonsense to a clearer headed me there s nothing i have to do on a day off i m sitting here right this second looking at the clock over and over thinking i wasted the last 0 minute watching youtube video when i could ve been playing video game but when i play video game instead i feel bad about not having watched a movie or new tv show instead it s so maddening ha anyone found a way to manage this constant sense of impatience

i am and i graduate in a couple of week i feel no where ready to graduate and i still feel like i m 9 i started applying for job but i do not have a full time offer yet it s so awful scrolling through linkedin seeing people posting that they accepted a full time job i m no where near there i m also a first generation student so there s that another one of my anxiety besides graduating from college is that my parent are moving to south florida i hate florida i hate the weather there and i love how it is up here in the northeast unfortunately i do not have the finance to move out even with roommate it would not work out i feel like i m going to be absolutely miserable in florida i hate the vibe there in fort lauderdale and florida to me is a place to visit not to live long term the idea of moving is so anxiety inducing and it just suck it also suck dealing with social anxiety which is preventing me from doing so much i hate it

so i just completed my rd admission a a inpatient and a big worry ha been my eye becoming damaged anyway on my way home today around pm to 0 when the sun is low and glare is heap the sun wa in my eye the whole way home i wa coming in from a angle you just couldn t block out i didn t have sunnys now i am paronoid i have sunburnt my eye or given them flash burn or whatever it is called i am already spiralling downward and can t even enjoy being my family again after being away for so long

my throat is always closed up and today it feel like someone ha their hand on my neck i get burning skin and twitch in my eye and so many other thing it make the mental battle that i go through 0 time harder i wish i could have a day off

several time throughout almost every night just a i m dozing off my body jar me awake convinced it just saved me from drifting off into death my heart race my chest tight exhausted almost to tear i ll sit up put my hand on my chest take deep breath lay back down and repeat up to 0 time a night sometimes anyone else experience this or have any advice i can t hardly sleep anymore

today i wa prescribed xanax and celexa for my depression and anxiety i have major anxiety about taking pill the side effect freak me out especially when it come to mental medication i ve took zoloft in the pas for a couple day and it freak me out with suicidal thought very angry and ticked off i m scared this might happen again i m so lost on what to do i really need the help but scared of the help

do you have a certain objekt or garment that your always carry with you something that make you uneasy if you dont have it with you i personaly always carry my noice cancelling headphone although i dont necesarily use them all the time

if you ve just been through something very stressful or a time of high anxiety be easy on yourself i know instinctually we expect to just bounce back immediately after said stressor is gone but high level of stress take a toll on both your mind and body it ll take some time to heal you might continue to feel stressed not a much a before but still be extra prone to anxiety trigger physically drained tense achey sour stomach nausea etc and before you freak out about how you feel think back to the basic before you jump to something scary did you eat enough today what did you eat did you drink enough water today how much sleep did you get this past week how sound wa that sleep did you have to take a different medication recently what s your posture been like any constant muscle tension have you socialized much recently have you gone outside recently think of these question not judgmentally but objectively sometimes it s hard to take perfect care of yourself it s not something to beat yourself up over say you re feeling really fatigued lately if you ve barely eaten anything and been getting poor sleep then it s not surprising at all that you d be tired that s on top of chronic anxiety which can cause unpleasant physical and mental symptom even when you re doing everything else right just because you feel crappy doesn t mean you have some scary life threatening disease it suck to feel like that but try not worry yourself over thing that at the moment are just fantasy granted if you feel like this all time like me i d recommend seeing a therapist and or psychiatrist maybe even going for a regular doctor visit if you haven t gone in a long time just to check in on thing basically what i m saying is don t scare yourself into a panic over your physical symptom but if you feel like they are interrupting your life it might be a good idea to seek help and there s nothing wrong with seeking help either if someone is having trouble seeing thing clearly they go to an optometrist for help this is the same thing for some reason or another our body brain isn t working how it should for u to lead a healthy life it s not our fault and it s not shameful to need help hope ya ll have a good week

ever since my girlfriend moved 0 minute away to college i find myself worrying that she s in danger or dead when i don t hear from her for a while i m still a senior in highschool during the day i m usually not worried about her safety but at night if i don t hear from her by the time i m going to bed at like 0 pm i start to agonize and worry that she s dead she doe taekwondo every evening until or 9 and then take a 0 minute trip from the dojo back to her dorm and if i don t hear from her by the time i go to bed i start to lose sleep over my anxiety this happens any time i have a reason to expect to hear from her and i don t she assures me that the school campus is safe and i have nothing to worry about she s also a very safe driver and she s tall and athletic and therefore probably difficult to kidnap but i hate to think about that i could ask her to check in with me more or to check in at certain time but i feel strongly against being overbearing or controlling and i don t want to cross her boundary i think it annoys her a little bit already how much i worry about her and how i panic if i don t hear from her but she also try to reassure me the best she can i can t seem to ever fight my anxiety with logic i only feel better after hearing from her i don t feel this way when i m with her and i didn t even feel this way when we lived in the same town but in different house any advice on how to stop worrying so much about her safety

hello everyone i m an 9 year old male with a perfectly normal bmi 9 lb or cm 0kg i ve never smoked in my life i ve never tried drug and i don t drink alcohol no history of cancer or heart issue in my family so it all begun this july when i woke up with an intense chest pain i thought i wa having a heart attack and my mother slashed me to the er i had a blood test ekg ultrasound everything wa clear one week later i caught covid but the symptom were mild and i wa also vaccinated so in september i took a cbc again in order to get an accutane treatment for my acne the cbc came back with high wbc and lymphocyte 0 and normal are 0 0 0 for wbc and 0 for lymphocyte they told me it might be cause of covid and i should retake the cbc in a month meanwhile i begun to get daily intense chest pain at the upper left part where i can feel my heart so i got another appointment with a cardiologist in october i went to the cardiologist who did an ekg echo they told i have very few pvc s but that wasnt something concerning for the doc so they told me i don t have any heart issue now my cbc came back with more elevated wbc and lymphocyte and at the time i had also developed everyday abdominal pain and lot of gas like i have to fart all the time and the fart last long also i feel a fullness to my abdomen and i get spasm or fasciculation all over my body everyday i got an abdominal ultrasound which came back normal my poop also come back in thin layer which look nothing like before in december i met with an hematologist oncologist who put me on like 0 test and everything came back clear except my wbc which were again elevated at this time and lymphocyte at in september they were 0 and in december the hematologist told me that i have a reactive lymphocyticosis and it s nothing serious before i caught covid in july at the er my wbc and lympho were perfectly normal he said i should retake a cbc in month in order to check i also visited a gastroenterologist who said that i probably have nothing since i m too young and prescribed me omeprazole for 0 day it didn t help at all i also take vit d supplement because i have a deficiency i also had a poop culture which came back clear i decided that i should look into my thyroid for the heart etc so i got a thyroid ultrasound and some lab with bloodwork everything came back clear again along with some inflammation lab crp igm igg igg which were all negative the latest test were conducted in december now it s been like month that i m living in daily pain i can feel something like a rapid heartbeat in my abdomen jerk or twitch hand back etc my body is pumping all the time i think they re called fasciculation i get them like every 0 minute and it s so so annoying i also get the intense chest pain everyday i feel like my heart is gon na leave me or something it s really painful and i feel like dying the pain is very intense my abdomen also hurt everyday i have so much gas and ramblings i think it s everywhere in my body and i can t stand it my belly usually hurt at the upper left part but the pain is everywhere i m also severely bloated i also got covid again just a few day before new year im afraid to take a cbc now cause i believe that my wbc will have skyrocketed my symptom were worse than first time i had a high fever for day 9 c and i still have some cough i feel that this will really mess my immune system more than it s already messed up i guess it s already messed up because my covid symptom were much worse than in july even though i had the delta variant in july and now the omicron which is weaker i asked if i can get a colonscopy but they told me that they re meant for people over the age of 0 and me with no family history i m not a candidate for it plus i have no blood weight loss etc pretty much every test i ve taken come up normal except my wbc which keep raising every month i m so afraid that i have something serious like colon cancer or crohn s my quality of life ha really deteriorated i can t study any more i m gon na fail my uni final i can t do anything i m in daily pain my heart hurt my acne ha dominated my body it s really everywhere chest back butt face even thigh we re talking really bad cystic acne here not pimple and with bad break out i can t lie on my bed because my back bleeds because of it and i still haven t gotten the accutane because of my blood i also want to start working out but the pain are scaring the shit out of me thinking that i m gon na pas on the treadmill or something the acne ha also destroyed my self esteem and it s worse than ever been battling with it for almost year now i also get random pain all over my body lower back headache arm etc i really don t wan na die yet but my life is really shitty hell i would give everything to feel good again tbh i don t know what test i can take anymore to shed some light in my case should i ask for an mri my parent have really got full of me i ve ripped them off by dragging them to so many appointment i ve had more than 0 since july they have to pay i can literally feel my left part of my belly pumping right now i ve tried taking laxative dulcolax for day but my constipation and thin stool turn into diarrhea and more pain i also get some sharp pain here and there that last a few second i m so afraid it s cancer tumor or leukemia or autoimmune which will make me suffer for life only the thought of it make me wan na vomit i m only 9 goddammit i think that covid might have triggered an autoimmune disease or something i guess my nerve system is really broken right now lastly my mentally healthy ha really deteriorated at this point symptom started at of july and today it s the th of march everything is a lot worse than it wa before i wake up from my sleep with panic attack i m thinking about death all the time

my whole life i ve dealt with the trifecta of depression anxiety and ocd i wa always functional with all disorder clocking in at maybe a 0 depression always felt like more of a chemical thing it wa never situationally based anxiety amp ocd were usually health related hypochondria i guess anyways i never knew episode existed i always just hovered at the same baseline then in 0 i had a severe panic attack after smoking some potent weed it really shook me and it sent me into what i guess would be my first episode it wa my first time experiencing dissociation and it terrified me i wa in a constant state of panic for month at the time i had been on lexapro for year my gp wa ill equipped to deal with this so she recommended a new doc for med big mistake new doc decided i should quit taking lexapro and switch to zoloft which perhaps would have worked if she had done it correctly instead of cross tapering or weaning off lexapro she decided to have me stop taking lexapro cold turkey wait a month until it wa out of my system and then start zoloft going cold turkey off lex wa a nightmare of biblical proportion and sent me further into the most intense depression and anxiety i d ever experienced after a hospital visit they suggested an outpatient program i agreed and there they got me back on the lexapro after a few more long month thing evened out i returned to a manageable baseline although the depression wa a tad higher because i could no longer self medicate with weed the experience ruined weed for me would immediately send me into panic mode but still thing were going well fast forward to january 0 and suddenly out of the blue i wake up one day super depressed no appetite couldn t sleep at night i wa so confused my first episode had a clear and obvious trigger panic attack ill advised cold turkey med change i d never had something like this happen with no trigger that s when i started to dig deeper and found out that episode exist this time i had a doc i trust added remeron which wa awesome at first felt better than i had in year wa sleeping and eating great for about 0 day then splat all that went away back to square one and i even developed tinnitus from the remeron so i nixed the remeron and we decided to switch from lexapro a well but the right way this time i did a seamless cross taper to effexor i m on my th week of it went from 0 my last day on the lexapro wa last friday which wa the day i did the increase to 0 thing have improved slightly def not where i wan na be tho i now know that episode can last anywhere from day to month or longer so i m trying to be patient it s tough tho eventually i may have to decide whether to increase effexor again or augment with something else an aa perhaps not sure what i meant to accomplish with this wall of text but if you read it kudos to you i guess i just wanted to document this strange journey maybe you ve been through something similar or know someone who ha maybe you can offer advice which i d welcome either way i hope whoever is reading this is doing well and i wish you all the best of luck in this thing called life

i ve had this ever since i wa young and now that i m in my adult year i feel like i m running out of time i m still at home and i feel stuck i can t hold down a job i ve lost over job let alone my therapist keep telling me to be compassionate towards myself but it s so hard i just want to be normal be happy my panic attack are bothering me lately more than ever and idk how to help it

hey guy i currently need some help figuring out what to do recently i ve been feeling a lot of anxiety it started a week ago when my spring break wa ending and the night before leaving for school i started having major anxiety i am a little worried about school i guess but i know i m good with grade and will be fine till the end of the semester but still i just felt this major anxiety like an aching in my chest and couldn t sleep the whole night when i got back to school i thought everything would be fine but around or 9 pm i started getting that feeling again like i wa panicking and having a tightness in my chest that wouldn t go away i don t think i wa even thinking about anything at the time to cause it that night i didn t fall asleep till or in the morning even during the day sometimes i ll start getting that same anxious feeling but it s ha been consistently happening every night around the same time and i have trouble falling asleep i m in a good place in my life i have friend and family who care about me and i m doing well in school but i can t shake this anxiety i m having any advice would be great

i ve been prescribed setraline a an anti depressant but i m beginning to have serious anxiety of the side effect especially the mental one i don t want to start taking them to relieve my anxiety and depression and then become suicidal my anxiety is making me think it will happen to me and i ve read so many story of people becoming suicidal because of taking setraline is there any advice anyone can think of to alleviate my worry

slept for about two hour woke up with my mind racing again couldn t eat dinner due to stomach pain from anxiety just want to quit work and start somewhere new again but it s not possible and will probably end up with the same issue i just wish i could restart everyday and fix every mistake of what i say and do can t keep living this way but i don t see how i can change the cycle i feel like i bring everyone around me down why am i like this i just want to turn my brain off

i know i ve already started this off pretty negative but i acknowledge that over the year i ve made a lot of progress with social anxiety i do thing now that i never thought i d be able to do presentation networking event planning hosting party however every time i do any of these thing or even small thing like having to run a work meeting i feel physically anxious my heart pound and i start doubting myself and my hand shake and i have to push through it because there s not usually another option i ve gotten better at it for sure and i m proud of that but sometimes it really just chip away at me i m about to cry tonight over something so minuscule that i ll probably look back on it in a few week and say wow that wa a dumb thing to worry about because that is what always happens i ve probably wasted day of my life just worrying about thing that didn t end up being worthy of that much worry i overthink thing so much and i just wish i could turn it off so badly to so many people now i appear to be this leader that ha shit together but in reality i struggle quietly with the most basic thing and i just feel so embarrassed sometimes i just wish i could turn off the social anxiety it get so frustrating

hey there everyone one of my biggest symptom ha been an extremely tight chest which seems to come over randomly for about 0 0 min sometimes longer and make everything terrible i ve been trying to find some solution that can help relieve this or maybe any tip going forward nothing seems to work so far except waiting them out which ha been exceptionally hard especially in bed i also would like to mention that i have a hormone imbalance a well i m not sure if the chest tightness is from that or the anxiety or both thanks

guy help i really need your opinion im a person who can overthink fromca simple thing just like now i feel bad for them my terrkr teach ask my friend and it take a minute so i decided to help but she got a wrong answer and i feel bad because i give a wrong answer do you think she hate me or mad at me gmfor giving a wrong answer because our terror teacher scold her but i dont know if she is mad at me but on our gc she just commenting on how she wa scared like that and i dont know if she mad st me

it s tuesday evening and i haven t been able to fall asleep in a few day because i can not stop replaying a sequence of event at work from last week i talked it out with my coworkers and i know that i wa in the right there wa nothing i could have done to get a better result and it s ok everything s cool let s move forward with our life k i would love for it to be that easy but that squishy asshole between my ear ha a very different perspective on the matter so we can t move forward we haven t earned that yet we have to spend an indeterminate amount of time meticulously dismantling and examining every minute detail of the incident my action and the reaction of everyone else involved buckle up and grab a barf bag folk it s about to get real whenever i have even a tiny stretch of free time the film reel in my head alternate between warp speed and slow motion depending on circumstance and timing every minute or so my brain get the ball rolling with really all the thing you could have done and that wa how you handled it idiot followed up with whoa you ve got nothing to worry about bae you handed that shit like a champ before circling back to what the fuck is wrong with you why why would you do something so heinously ridiculous this is why nobody want to be around you this shit right here and after that we get another no don t listen to that mess you are entitled to occupy space on this planet without apoligizing for your own existence but then that s hilarious see how far that attitude get you tomorrow after everyone ha had time to think about what happened and they realize what an immature out of touch self centered asshole you are have fun dying alone and unremembered and then every few minute the pattern repeat itself in an infinite loop of madness half assed self justification and shame this can go on for day sometimes week or month but it never permanently stop sometimes a certain song a smell a facebook memory or a half heard remark from across the room will launch my as back in time to tear myself to shred over an instance that ha been dead buried and forgotten by the rest of the human race except for me lather rinse repeat go fuck yourself wave of abject misery and self loathing interspersed with flash of contentment that might occasionally brighten thing up but it never really stop or get any better the best i can really hope for is the drop off in frequency that occurs after a few week or ideally i might forget about the incident entirely until i get hit with a trigger again at least

what do you guy think will this finally change my life buspasfar mg day escitalopram 0mg bupropion 0

my anxiety affect my life but it s not debilitating for me like it is for others i get panic attack very rarely my brain is never quiet though it s always going and cycling around thought even when i m trying to let them go i see my dog and feel happy then my brain immediately say what if he died though and it show me what that would look like stupid thing like that i also have ibs that worsens with stress i guess i wa just wondering if anyone out there ha tried any med even though they can deal with their symptom and if it helped i m a bit worried about side effect but if i could just live without having to ob over thing and feel defensive all the time that would be pretty amazing i will ask my doctor of course but wanted to hear from others in my situation

some backstory i have crohn s disease but am currently in remission so physically and health wise i ve been doing well the combination of medication that i m on seem to be doing their job and overall i feel pretty good so over the last year and a half or so i ve developed this awful anxiety habit of being terrified that i m suddenly going to get sick and need to shit and not be able to find a bathroom when i m out and about and it s taken a toll on my everyday life i can not leave the house for work in the morning without returning the bathroom sometimes more time before i finally work up the courage to get out the door because i m terrified that somewhere along my minute commute i m going to feel the urge and not be able to get to a bathroom fast enough the thing is if i m just at home all day i likely will only have to shit probably once but if i even think about leaving the house i instantly have to go to the bathroom if i have plan i have to schedule my day around how much time im going to need to spend in the bathroom before i can leave i have to feel like i ve emptied out a much a possible before i can get in the car i don t even hang out with friend or date anybody anymore because the stress of this situation is just too much taking my kid to the beach or the park ugh if i m not 00 positive there will be a public restroom available there we aren t going and i hate that it s not only affecting me but thing like that are and will continue to affect my daughter if i don t get a grip on it soon another example of this is i have the opportunity to send her to a much better school and one of the thing that s holding me back is i m terrified of what morning drop off will look like that i don t think there s bathroom available for parent to access during those time the business around the school aren t open that early to access it start earlier so i ll have to leave earlier to drop her off thus leaving me le time to sit on the toilet before we head out etc etc it feel so stupid but to me it s so real i don t even know how to really put it all into word the anxiousness i feel about it it s such a weird thing that i don t really know how to talk to anyone about because i ve never met someone else with this kind of issue doe anyone else struggle with this i feel like i don t even remember what life felt like before i developed this weird anxiety around it my life feel like it revolves around knowing where the bathroom is sorry for the long post this wa kind of a looking for support asking for help needing to vent post thanks for reading if you got this far sorry i rambled on a bit i don t even know where to start

i ve been having a lot of thought of am i going crazy surely i must be going crazy i know derealization is just an anxiety symptom but i want to just hear if others experience the same thing and i m constantly worried this will result in psychosis like it s a fear that i don t want to end up in a mental hospital or go crazy

a friend of mine gave me feedback about something and it came off a harsh and being a sensitive person it really bothered me then i wa so upset i sobbed a few different time over the last few day then all of the sudden i called them and talked about it and told them how i felt and then i felt vibrant energetic and super enthusiastic this behavior kind of scare me should it i ve suffered from bad anxiety since i wa and i m now

i started therapy for the panic attack that i ve been having it s definitely helped and my therapist recommended that i d benefit from having a medication to take a needed he thought this would help me continue to push the boundary that trigger the panic and that those exposure would help resolve thing he s a sole practitioner and a lcsw i made the appointment with my regular doctor who told me that even with the therapist recommendation he wouldn t write a prescription for a controlled substance and i needed to see a psychiatrist i didn t know these drug were controlled another month pass by while i wait for the psychiatrist appointment hour and 0 later they tell me the same thing they will only prescribe something that i take every day i don t want to take daily medication and my therapist seems to think that s not the best choice i m not a doctor and am just trying to do the best i can to get better am i asking for something crazy is there a medication that isn t controlled that i could ask for or reference i m trying really hard to get out of my comfort zone and get thing back to normal both for me and for my family i feel like a drug seeker now and am embarrassed to go see another psychiatrist i m not sure what i m supposed to do next

hi i suffer from mild anxiety not many physical symptom anybody ha tip to deal with anxiety that aren t in the stay positive realm usually the help i find online is about staying positive however that is not my mindset i think life is not meant to be positive always and i genuinely believe it s bad for mental health to try and see the bright side of any situation negative feeling are just meant to be lived thru at the same time i know my brain lie to me about people disliking me about sounding like a fool about my future the most tricky part is that i also can t stop thinking about the truly awful stuff mostly about the world being a terrible place the stay positive people can not tell me the bright side of my shoe being made thru human exploitation in a remote country you know how can i be happy knowing there s all this pain in the world

i ve been pretty bloated the past few day happens a lot working on finding out the cause whenever i eat a meal my belly boost up and my heart rate sits at like 0 for around half an hour until thing start to deflate i m currently in the hospital for a completely unrelated surgical stay and it make my anxiety even worse because to the nurse it look worrying i think most of them have realized it s not an actual heart issue it happens so often and i ve had many ecg that were fine it doesn t help that having my pulse tested also cause my right to shoot up just hoping to hear i m not alone i guess haha

a month ago my friend group dropped me because the past few month have been tiring after a situation that involved my crush i kept bothering them about it and it wa just not the same after that i understand where they where coming from though a of right now we re just mutuals we talk in class sometimes and wave to each other in the hallway and smile no drama or anything happened but one person kinda told everyone we ended on good term which im glad happened now i hang out with my other friend we are a trio and we have each other s back nothing is awkward we just vibe with each other let call them em and ki ki is a very friendly person if one of u ha a dislike towards someone she would still talk to them cause shes good with them and they have no drama yesterday ki wa invited to lunch by my ex friend they have been talking and getting closer today in the corner of my eye i see them playing imessage game and just texting each other honestly im just worried that shell hang out with them more often and ill be alone for lunch i am not in charge of who she hang out with i don t mind at all if they re friend she said that our friend group is kind of her main lunch friend group so we hang out like most of the time she said if my ex friend kept inviting her she would probably go maybe a few time i honestly don t know why im worried im overthinking and stressing out a lot right now ive always been like this im afraid to be alone

a couple week ago i contracted covid and got it pretty bad for a few day there it caused a big flare up of anxiety for me a i am a heavy cannabis and nicotine smoker and i couldn t give them up while dealing with covid and inevitably the smoking made it worse and played into my anxiety for background i have been managing anxiety fairly well for the past or year with habitual cannabis smoking but sometime in the week i had covid a switch wa flicked and smoking instantly made me more anxious i went to the doctor and have been prescribed seroquel in the morning and evening same with diazepam plus zoloft in the morning i m wondering if this sound like the proper response to deal with this flare up or do you think my doctor is going down the wrong path he doe know my history with anxiety and explained the mechanic of dealing with the anxiety first and then dealing with smoking and told me that i should keep on smoking even though it put me in a vicious cycle so a to not have to deal with withdrawal at the same time a the anxiety he booked me an appointment for two week time to review how thing are working but made no mention of referring me to anything external or anything to do with cbt

my dad life 000 mile away from me a well a the rest of my family he s an alcoholic kind of emotional abusive and kicked me out when i wa after my mom died he said some pretty horrible thing to me when he did that but i ve blocked them out so i don t remember really he doesn t really reach out very much due to being blackout drunk off and on a lot but when he doe i get so anxious to answer his call that i don t do it and i just text him instead or don t answer i m worried it make him sad and drink more my sister ha said in the past he resents that i left them back home and moved on with my life i already feel guilty about leaving them my younger sibling so that hurt to hear it s not just my dad though i don t keep up with my grandparent anymore i m worried they re going to die they re kind of old and i m going to regret not talking to them more often mostly my grandma i regret not spending more time with my mom i have multiple younger sibling one of which is underage and ha autism i feel guilty that i don t call them brother and sister and worry that they resent me for leaving and i don t understand why it s so hard for me to just pick up the phone once a week and call these people the only person i talk to often is my sister what is wrong with me why is it so hard scary anxious for me to talk to them yet i feel so guilty by not doing so it s very tiring i know i need to go to therapy but i don t have insurance and can t really afford it also i don t keep in touch with friend which make me sad since my only friend is my partner really i am very family oriented and i love spending time with my sibling when i visit

so i have a disabling chronic illness last year i went through some pretty severe stuff almost starved to death because my stomach doesn t work properly and won t digest food had to be hospitalized and have a permenant feeding tube placed etc that s just backstory that might be relevant but honestly i m not sure i have this overwhelming anxiety any time anything slightly untword happens to my partner it s particularly unmanageable when it come to them feeling physically unwell i have no idea why this happens it s something i ve experienced in other very close relationship a well but it s not everyone not even everyone i care very deeply about it s super weird and i have no idea where it s coming from but i need it to stop because i want to be supportive and i can t do that if my partner know i m fighting down a lot of anxiety just to talk about them feeling like they might be coming down with a tiny cold the anxiety can even bleed into feeling of anger or frustration which i hate even more because who get angry about something like that am i just a bad person how do i cope with this in a way that doesn t negate their experience by requiring them to constantly tell me nothing is wrong or that everything is fine but also not going off the deep end and feeling crazy with fear just because they might be experiencing discomfort
