i am year old and i finallly came to the conclusion that i need help with anxiety i signed up for therapy and will have my first session in a couple of day prior to the therapy session i met with a prescriber to discus medication they recomended starting me off on zoloft or lexapro in general i tend to think of medication a a last resort not just for thing like this but in all aspect for example i rarely used medinces perscribed to me for pain after surgery and would only use them if absolutely necesarry i don t even like taking ibuprofen for a headache unless it is unbearable given that i am trying to figure out whether or going on anxiety medication is necessary for me or not i am worried about going on something for the rest of my life and am a little concerned about the side effect on the other hand i have been reading some post on here about how much med helped people i am hoping to hear from some people that have been on any of these medication and what their experience were also if anyone ha any thought on whether or not someone that is new to this whole anexiety improvement journey should jump into med or just try therapy first and see how that go i always kind of ignored my anxiety and told myself that since i have been able to graduate from college with a good degree hold down a great job for several year and maintain good relationship that my anxiety must not be that bad but a time go by i am starting to feel like it is getting worse and is negatively impacting my happiness and is leading my to lean on stimulant and alcohol too much which doesn t seem like a long term healthy way of handling this i have also had a couple of concussion in the last few year so i am not sure how much that play into what i am going through i would really appreciate it if some people could speak to their experience or have any encouragement or advice for someone just starting out in therapy and potentially medication please reach out if i can add additional context to my situation to help clarity where i am at also i wa reading some other post on this sub about people being tired all of the time i have spent year trying to figure out medically why to no avail i am starting to wondering if my axiety is causing it can anyone speak to any experience or epiphany they have had with this thanks garrison

it turned into a fear of leaving the house or even driving a mile away from fear of having a panic attack it just getting terrible and it just so much to take like month ago i wa living in a big city walking mile to and from work by myself on a busy street no problem now im terrified of even driving a couple mile to a gas station without fear of a terrifying panic attack

hello all i am in need of some advice and input on behalf of my wife she wa officially diagnosed with anxiety a few year ago now and she hasn t really pursued any sort of treatment it s a very sensitive topic to her and so we haven t really discussed her option medication is an especially taboo topic she ha a ton of hesitation about starting medication because she doesn t think the side effect and downside are worth the potential positive aspect i guess i wa just hoping for some advice personal experience and input about this situation what ha worked and helped what hasn t etc particularly about experience with medication and such thank you so much for your help

for awhile i ve been having thought like these i ve spoken to my therapist and i can t really say she s said much i m trying to make it become a bigger topic but these thought seem so weird and i m not sure how to deal with them it s really extreme stuff too i don t see anyone forgetting like i will literally sit there and be like what if i cheated on my boyfriend and just don t remember it you people reading this probably think i m so stupid but it can t just be me

doe anyone do the freeze thing a their fight flight freeze reaction and how do you work through that especially when it happens at your job i sometimes sort of just malfunction and can t speak and lose all my thought i don t even know why it happens sometimes but it happens a lot when i make a mistake or do something wrong and then someone higher up try to talk to me about it it s especially annoying and embarrassing in that situation because i sometimes also end up cry or getting teary and i want to just be able to take the blame or whatever but i end up feeling like i m manipulating everyone into just feeling bad for me or if i m not cry and i can t speak i don t want them to think i don t care the other day i had that happen and the assistant director who wa telling me not to do what i did noticed i wa getting emotional and i could tell she didn t know how to respond but i couldn t speak and explain myself i feel so confident sometimes about certain thing and i feel like i ve gained a level of confidence over the past few year and yet at the same time this particular experience feel like it s getting worse and for background i have never been abused or in and abusive relationship and i know this is a very common for people who have been in those scenario so i don t really know why i react that way sooo ha anyone experienced this and maybe have some word of advice what do you do in these situation

i just started a new job week ago i work there day a week for hour just to pay my bill while i m studying so far i ve been dreading every single day so much that i m actually super nervous the day before and it seems like it s not getting better at all i still feel like i know barely anything and i have to ask my coworkers about literally everything and i m insanely anxious and uncomfortable in that work environment i honestly don t even know why or what exactly the issue is but i m having a really hard time feeling at home there if i remember correctly my last job wa completely fine after a week it s funny because it s just stocking shelf at a supermarket in the morning that s my job and i m anxious about it so how long do you think it ll take to get comfortable to actually not being scared a hell of going there

i m just completely un able to let go of the past i m sat here thinking about last year i remember being so much happier and stress free but last year i had the exact same issue except i wa thinking about the year prior to that maybe this is just a natural process of growing up i m and i guess life is just gon na get worse from here on in do you think the past just seems better in my head than it actually wa because i seem addicted to it atm

hey people 0 started with one huge panic attack and dissociation and all that fancy stuff for me that really messed it all up about ish month ago i started going to therapy and i can leave the house feel normal and do all the thing even stay in front of people with no issue all that stuff but when it s about pm or later i get this insane exhaustion and zoned out feel i get sensitive i feel like my head is full of wool and i am very sensitive to dissociating which could result in panic moment i have my survival kit inspired by people with bpd some stuff i can touch some stuff to smell including ammonia capsule for super intense moment which i have never used before and all that but this is more for the acute stuff the zoning out in the evening creep up on me it doesn t come 0 to 00 in a few second it arrives slowly and go away slowly and it is so annoying i would even say that without this feeling i would be 90ish anxiety free that s because this feeling is the main thing that lead to anxiety in the first place some topic i am sensitive to but that s not relevant for this post without this massive exhaustive burst and the zoning out i would feel what i consider to be normal mindfulness meditation can sometimes get me out of this but this is usually sort of a training that help me control the stuff when it s there or for accepting it but i wan na know if there is something that can help me in my daily management to not even have it happen or at least reduce it oh btw showering help too and eating also reduces zoning out weirdly enough since i started zoning out i am not really able to properly detect hunger anger and zoning out usually come first for context i am a university student with ton of deadline in my back i am easily stressed but i have no other choice than powering through i am semi successful with all that uni stuff but it work i can run the household too i take care of myself i cook healthy food i shower and working out is on the plan too but not existant rn because i have so many assignment to take care of thanks for any help i know this is a lot of random text but i am just looking for someone who is experiencing similiar thing

i ve been taking escitalopram for a while now it s helped in that i can t even remember the last time i had a panic attack however i have this really weird feeling it s like i have no strong emotion no motivation for anything the thing that brought me joy before don t anymore is this a symptom of something else i don t remember feeling like this before

it may sound strange but i ve come to realize most of my anxiety stem from my appearance whenever i m out in public i get a rush of depression because i feel like i am ugly and everyone s judging me for it in reality i know it s not true because even if i wa hideous nobody would care it s just in the moment it feel so real and unbearable

i hate myself right now because of my anxiety i hate the anxiety and i hate that it make me hate myself i hate that i didn t ask to have anxiety i hate that i didn t ask to be raised in a culty religion that wired my brain to have such a narrow view of the world i hate that i wa raised in that religion by a manipulative mother so now it is difficult to believe anyone i just freaking hate it all ultimately i hate myself for hating myself because i didn t cause this and i shouldn t have to suffer because of how other people treated me

anyone else get so distracted by so much around you that you just put off everything i ve been taking zoloft and literally since i ve taken it i ve been so unorganized it s hard for me to keep my room clean i have a bunch of appointment i have to make but keep forgetting to i have a credit card that i need to start using to build my credit but i haven t even read on it yet or gotten it activated i wan na travel and do all of this stuff i ve just been so tired i have so much to keep up with and the anxiety make me nervous to even go to appointment i need to go to the g i doc the breast cancer doc the dentist the gyno all of this stuff i need help getting organized i used to be so organized and now i feel like i m not at all

hello i age have been feeling like i m going crazy these past month after i got my first panic attack i been having all kind of symptom like not feeling my hand before the panic attack but now i been getting disoriented feeling like im like a camera stuck in my head looking at mirror and not feeling properly like myself if i look to the side of me i get scared even yesterday night before sleeping i had a moment that my brain thought i wa doing something and i actually wa believing that i wa doing it for split second been feeling like my heart is dropping a lot my brain skip moment and this all concern me is this all anxiety

basically i had chest pain and headache caused by anxiety it felt like having heart attack lack of breathing everything the full package it used to be now it s a lot le like day a week whole day now i am active having fun with friend having fun life but still experiencing major lack of energy like i did not sleep for day it s very annoying constantly felling like i am about to collapse from tiredness

for the past month i ve been struggling with crippling anxiety that s manifested into some terrifying physical symptom and panic attack i ve gone to the er three time due to panic attack causing me to believe that i wa having a heart attack or pulmonary embolism my head gi system and cardiovascular system have been really angry with me a of late i ve had zero motivation for anything however today i managed to clean my kitchen living room and bedroom i ve vacuumed dusted did the dish did the laundry put away thing and am going to clean my bathroom considering my health anxiety s made me believe i can t do any amount of work without dying i think this is a success i just needed to celebrate that fyi i started 0mg prozac almost three week ago and i believe a lot of my symptom are my body adjusting to that i start therapy a week and a half from now and i have a med check the following day

i can only explain it a a similar feeling to when you re drunk and your head feel heavy and you feel a bit woozy thing aren t moving and the room isn t spinning but because i have a fear or being dizzy i focus on it so much that i ll look at something to see if it move and then eventually it will obviously that s because i m focussing so hard doe anyone else suffer with anything similar how do you counteract it

so at the place where i work we had a new girl started off okay work got crazy and we were under the impression she had it under control question were minimal she seemed okay then she wa out sick and we had to take over her desk and long story short there were several thing found that made her a liability and could possibly get u sued by our customer thankfully all thing were corrected and we re okay but now they want to fire her it wa decided that she s out a soon a she s ready to come back from being sick i feel so bad and anxious about this which i voiced to my supervisor who happens to be my mom i said that i didn t feel bad she wa being fired because she deserves it for the huge mistake she s repeatedly been making i feel bad because she s at home having a hard time allegedly but think that she still ha a job like if that wa me i d probably never recover i noticed this anxiety ha me wondering if my relationship is happening the same way where i ll find out later with seemingly no warning that it s not okay and i m fired it s just so hard and i feel so bad but a much a i try to distance myself i can t and i don t know how to make this stop

i ve been ill with sinusitis for about week with vertigo anyway cut to the past day i ve been freaking out a it ha been hard to breathe a it sometimes feel like i m choking on water but one of the scariest thing wa that my mouth ha been a bit foamy could this be from dehydration or could it be from nothing serious i really hope it s nothing serious a i have some other mental health condition that can cause some very scary freak out over something small

i ve been waking up with anxiety attack every day for the past week it s been a while since my morning anxiety wa this bad i usually get anxious around people or quite randomly throughout the day which i m used to i ve had that since i wa so i can sort of handle that more or le but man the morning anxiety ha me losing my mind i can t function for hour i either lay in bed with racing heart amp thought unable to move or i m the most fuzzy hyperactive person on earth running around doing random stuff just trying to get away from my thought and hoping it ll somehow calm me down i ve tried breathing exercise meditation stretching taking a shower doing stuff to distract me doesn t help much i have to wait til it go away which take around h for me another hour or two until i feel normal again doe anybody have tip please i just wan na be able to manage this until i can get help the worse it get the more scared i get that i ll fail my university class cause i can t get sh t done which in turn make my anxiety worse vicious cycle

i just started citalopram this month and my period is late could this be a symptom of starting a ssri

a little over a month ago i wa over at a friend s house and got to drinking pretty heavily over the night that i spent a his place every so often he would take the bottle away from me and temporarily and hide because he had the impression that i downing a full bottle of liquor at a dangerously fast pace for whatever neurotic reason the idea became supplanted in my head that he wa trying to intentionally hide it away from me so he could spike the bottle with a finely powdered lead in order to cause me to ingest large amount of a neurotoxic chemical to produce measurable brain damage surely this isn t likely whatsoever right it s all i ve been able to ob and ruminate over for well over a month now i could elaborate on a million different pattern and detail and inform you of the interpersonal context between the both of u but then i feel like i d be trying to create and extract a specific response out of people these are the bare bone and objective happening of the night in mention i ve even seen a doctor about trying to get tested for possible acute lead exposure and hinted towards psychological deterioration on a quantifiable level my intuition tell me that my saboteur had successfully managed to reduce my iq by several point and inflict a speech impediment issue which involves a portmanteau synthesis between word in my inner dialogue the way that it wa explained to me from a team of professional who discussed my case wa that because i m an adult it s much harder for a single instance of lead exposure ingestion to be absorbed or produce any perceptible effect or cross the blood brain barrier due to a lack of iron deficiency and binding capacity to red blood cell ergo a test would not be necessary or productive in my case however i can t shake the idea out of my mind i can t dissolve it or even compartmentalize it a i navigate through the day it s escalated to the point where it s infected every part of my conscious thinking and convinced me that i m no longer capable of achieving any of the goal i ve set for myself with my newfound profound disability that are only noticeable to me surely this is something so asinine so comically absurd that the idea should be laughed at the point of it conception why can t i disentangle the idea from my head it s put me into a state of complete inaction i m too paranoid to engage in any socially or mentally stimulating activity because i m terrified that the sting of observing my cognitive deficit in real time will manifest and i won t be able to articulate myself to anyone or anything for the rest of my life and the stuttering habit i never had that issue before never have i ever possessed an affinity for transposing syllable or stating sentence in incorreclty disjointed sequence i used to write quite frequently before this and conversely i feel an all consuming negation of my emotional affectivity and spontaneity my thought aren t being organically generated and i feel a if i have to strain to think of anything lucid or insightful is it natural to feel like your thought have been utterly attenuated and obliterated with anxiety is it normal to feel a if time is accelerating itself faster than your consciousness can adapt to it progression is it natural to feel former part of your identity and desire to become increasingly disfigured obscured and foreign to yourself the aforementioned friend that i spoke of no longer talk to me a we had a falling out with one another over a relationship that wa rife with gaslighting think of the breadcrumbing tactic some narcissist employ maybe that spurred the main causal effect for why i m patternizing my memory in the way that i am but pouring granulated lead into my liquor without me noticing or it producing any physiological effect that s laughable right

i really need a place to vent right now so i kinda moved out for university i wa here for october and november then my school closed due to corona so i wa at home and school started one week ago i still have the opportunity to go home every weekend it a little pricey but still affordable for me so i am home every weekend and during the week i have my own apartment that i really really like but my mental health is so bad here i really dont understand why because im really not far away from my home town i have friend here and a really cute apartment and im so grateful that i can study and live here but i feel so fucking bad my anxiety is so bad i really cant do anything but worry all the time and i dont even know why i am worring it make it really hard for me to eat because i have a lot of problem with eating when im really anxious which make me just more anxious also i feel kinda bad because i am nineteen and so many people in my age can handle living alone so well i know that i shouldnt compare myself with others but i do i cant imagine living b my own at any age but i know that someday i have to and that i cant live with my mom forever idk if someone feel the same but i still feel like a kid most of the time im not ready for being an adult i really cant explain it to myself because i wa a really independent child and it wa always important for me being independent i never had problem with not being home for week but now i cant even be alone for day i know that in this community there are people who are a little older than me and have a little more experience did somebody felt the same way a i do now with moving out and doe it get better

there is someone in my life i need to have a conversation with i tell myself i really need to do this to answer the question i keep asking myself and if it doesn t get better then i ll know it s time to cut them out i know i have to do this it will make everything better and solve the problem i got myself ready to start this conversation under the thought that a long a i m trying to communicate it s a win in my book i open the chat and think about typing and i tell myself why even bother it doesn t matter he doesn t care to hear your thought and when you do tell him he s not going to want to fix the problem it s so frustrating because i know what the problem is and how to fix it and i can t i don t know how to take the next step

apology if this is confusing i m having an anxiety attack while writing this like most people at the start of the pandemic i got sent to wfh which eventually turned into permanent wfh i loved it my job doesn t involve speaking with people unless it s on my own time and i m only in charge of a handful of people and only deal with the people who need the most help i got to sink into my own little bubble and it s coming back to bite me i ve realized my social anxiety ha gotten so much worse than it ever ha i have so much fear just speaking to other people that i feel insane acting like this recently a promotion became available and i don t want to apply i made the dumb mistake of telling my partner about the opening and he s pressuring me to do it i feel physically sick at the idea of doing this some of it is because i m going to be judged but a lot of it is because i will have to do more in the sense of talking to people i can t get away with meeting a month with people i already know it will be constant employee contact and even meeting with people i don t know i m stressed if the pandemic had never happened i could do it i use to be able to flick a switch and become a whole different person at work who only had minimal anxiety now because home is work i can t feel that separation i try to make my work in a different location within my house but it s not easy with my house set up i know i m going to have to do it whether i want to or not because we need the money and the benefit also i wouldn t be able to forgive myself if i didn t at least try but i m so scared i m worried if i do get it that i will be having constant anxiety attack until i m use to the job i just don t know if i can mentally handle that i m worried if i don t get it i will just be constantly overthinking and causing myself anxiety over not being good enough it s a lose lose situation for me and there isn t anything i can do i just want to run away and bury my head in the sand but i can t so i ll do it knowing the consequence and hope for the best

i ve tried different table from the doctor and they all have really bad side effect i also can t live with i ve tried talking i ve tried working out i ve tried meditation and breathing technique is there anything else i can try

m no underlying physical health issue known i started taking 0mg propranolol a few week ago missing some day and on others taking tablet when needed they have deffo helped relieve that horrible fight or flight feeling however two side effect i can t stop thinking about which don t seem to be mentioned in the leaflet are the odd heart palpitation and possibly a bit of a cough these typically occur hour after taking the tablet sometimes i don t experience these symptom on others they re quite noticeable i do feel really calm and relaxed after taking them and don t want benzo s ssri but when i experience the heart palpitation i freak out also the cough is kind of worrying too it could be a coincidence i did have covid month ago google of course mention load of other possibility which is nerving anyone else been in a similar boat i thought beta blocker were meant to prevent heart palpitation

my habit is having to check on my betta fish and make sure he is doing ok before i go to sleep i prompt him to swim up to me and flare stick his gill out it s how bettas express emotion before i can sleep

i have these bad episode of anxiety that last for day where i m constantly dissociated and whenever i try to sleep i wake up almost every hour with my body completely numb and my vision is like zoomed out and everything is super disoriented and weird i m so tired but i can t sleep and it keep me up all night and i m so exhausted i just want at least one good night rest but i can t even get that i feel like anxiety and dissociation are constantly kicking me around and i can never catch a break in life

i want to share something my therapist told me that really resonated and stuck with me she said anxiety is like a smoke detector it go off whenever there smoke to keep you safe but a smoke detector doesn t know the difference between a fire or burnt toast so it s our job to identify what s making the alarm go off and how to manage it most of the time it just burnt toast even if you panic when the alarm first ring you soon realise it burnt toast though difficult anxiety sometimes just need u to take a second to identify the source and put it into perspective is it manageable what s the best way for me to approach it without avoiding it so yeah burnt toast

hello i m having some trouble understanding my life rn i had a event that i would consider traumatic last year and i don t feel like i haven t been the same since i developed dissociation and depersonalization for a month i had trouble feeling like i and everything around me wa real i have self diagnosed depression and even then i could talk to my friend and have deep relationship with people now i don t feel talking to anyone and i have a hard time reaching out to my friend i have trouble concentrating and functioning a a student and i ignored basically all of my responsibility for the last two month for videogames i ve had episode where i have a lot of anger or i find it hard to breathe when i do something wrong and i ve also had a hard time sleeping i ve recently gone to therapy but i don t feel like it s helping my life feel like hell and my suicidal thought have been stronger

please help i need to know if any of you have been on some type of medication for your anxiety and depression and if it s worth me giving it a shot i ve set the date and found the method of my suicide but i want to give life one last try before i pull the final curtain one reason i didn t want to go on medication is because i ve heard it just make you worse and you become too dependent on it in 0 0 my gp didn t want to medicate me after telling him i d made an attempt on my life instead he said to try therapy first which i did in 0 and whilst it wa interesting and i liked my therapist it didn t actually help me please let me know of your experience with being medicated for your depression and anxiety also if you could mention the drug they gave you that would be great thanks

hey friend i come asking question about workplace anxiety i m 9 and work retail i realize that this is a job with low stake and that whatever fear i have about making mistake are rather silly given the nature of the job however i ve worked myself up because i worked an event this evening and in my eye it wa just a series of unfortunate event first i show up early but still later than my coworker who i wa working with for the event he wa talking to our bos second i wa underdressed he looked so sharp granted i am 9 and he is almost a full decade older than me with the life experience to really comprehend dress code it wa rather unspecified and unclear so i m trying not to beat myself up too much about it i ran home super quickly and grabbed some nicer shoe and a jacket but it still wasn t great third my bos gave u her number to text or to call if we needed any help i texted her first and then she asked if i would call her because she wa on the road make sense but i feel i made a mistake texting her in the first place fourth fifth sixth and so on i worry that throughout the entire evening i wad screwing up and ended up losing the store a ton of money i m so upset about everything that happened and being liked by my bos that i wa cry and now i can t sleep please oh please i beg of y all how do i get over this it s making my day really difficult and i don t want this to follow me into the future when if i have a job much more demanding and serious if i mess up it s eating me up and i can t take it thanks

weird phrasing for clarity post not being taken down seriously how do i cope there s a lot of trigger caused by individual everywhere including medium and online by the misinformation they spread it s gaslighting to constantly see and hear fake information that contradicts my experience a a survivor how do i cope with this i know if anything fall through i will receive false promise of aid to waste my time i know i will be told i m seeking attention i know i will be told that i m the abuser how do i cope with this a a survivor i will be posting this wherever i can because i guess some subreddits do not help with this for some reason
