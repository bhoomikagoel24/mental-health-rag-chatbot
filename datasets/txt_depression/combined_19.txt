i don t know if this is the right place to write this but before quarantine 0 9 i just thought i wa an introvert and just a very organized and methodic person but then on quarantine i started to realize that i seem to get a lot more anxious than most people and always keep thinking about stuff that happened a second ago always think about what someone s thinking about me if i did or said something wrong always think about everything that can go wrong everywhere i go memorizing the menu a week before etc and i thought the problem for a big part of the anxiety wa online class and being stuck at home with my parent they re nice tho so when i finally got to go do an exchange semester abroad i get to be outside all the time i meet new people gt the freaking anxiety is still here and that make me think that nothing is gon na make it go away but i need it to go away cause i feel like i am an introvert but i make one wrong move i just go from quiet introvert to weird and lose all the people i met i mean met that s really the right word because i just can t seem to do the right thing i don t know some of my roommate that got here the same week a me go out every night with friend and i m just stuck at the same awkward convo phase and it s not like that i scared to talk to people or i don t like talking to people i do it s just when i come back home i start to rethink every single word that i said and blame myself for the smalled little mistake i m just really lost sometimes i think what i do how i think is normal but then it doesn t i didn t even know what anxiety wa until a year or so ago so

so i recently started my first customer service job and wa doing well until it came to order taking i wa making order before at the register inside i m not great but okay but the register at the drive through i seem to have worse anxiety while talking with people i don t know and can t see for some reason and on top of that everything that happens at the drive through is broadcasted to anyone wearing a headset and on top of that my medication wa screwing me up any time i missed even one dose i wa waning off but having trouble with the final drop off and i wa on the verge of a breakdown all day and the drive through wa what pushed it too far and i had to leave early to get my medication my medication still aren t stable and i m having a very anxious episode that s been happening since i started getting off the medication far worse than it wa before how have you managed to cope with this anxiety and perform necessary work interaction with stranger repeatedly

my adhd make it impossible to stop thinking about what s giving me anxiety i try to breath focus my mind off thing but instantly it come right back cause i can t control my mind most of the time i m not even thinking about anything that is anxiety inducing but in the back of my mind something is happening that won t let it stop anyone have experience with anxiety and adhd

should i ask my parent for a therapy session i m scared to ask my parent for therapy and i come seeking opinion on what i should do i m y o and these feeling have been killing me i m sure change in hormone have a part in this but i have been dealing with feeling of poor self worth since i wa i begin slightly shaking clinging and breathing heavily with excessive worry and fear almost daily now but i m worried my parent will say average teenage feeling and leave it at that i also don t want to waste money on something that might be just a phase and so i m asking for thought on this matter now for a little backstory my writing may be a little messy so i apologize in advance thinking back i ve had symptom of anxiety for a while now i wa yelled at a lot a a child for very trivial matter and still to this day ill get hour long lecture for thing that arent that big of a deal after a specific scolding when i wa around i believe that kickstarted thing i started playing what i saw and heard in my mind over and over again until i got night terror for some reason i can still recall this moment and it still scare me i became afraid of a certain speed like m p h a strange thing to be afraid of i know don t know if this is just some sort of trauma type thing or what but it wa always weird to me i start sweating and shaking whenever i think about anything with that specific speed and i don t know what that mean anyways fast forward to early 0 9 and my grandma passed away she wa the only one i truly felt attached to and trusted i have trust issue don t know why so her passing hit me hard a year later when covid started my dad cheated with my best friend s mom ending in a lot of self confidence issue and when my trust issue began showing my parent are still together they just argued and eventually got it worked out since i don t want everything to go downhill again i just bottled up everything and hid what i felt now to the present day this is why i find it so difficult to ask for a therapist i m afraid that my parent will just brush it off or be disappointed and think they did something wrong this hopefully doesn t give the wrong idea about my parent i believe they tried their best and to be honest didn t do a horrible job there were still good time i remember and they ve done a lot for me unfortunately i can t truly say i love you back without my parent telling me and that hurt i know people have it much worse than me and that s another reason that s holding me back from asking either way i m still heavily considering therapy and why i m asking you is it just a phase will i benefit from a professional am i being petty and should just deal with it i m not looking for a diagnosis but would love some thought on the matter and will try my best to answer any question if any thanks p s i hope this wasn t too long i tried to cram a much information a possible without it being accessive apology for any grammar mistake

hi i m haven t had many female friend growing up now that i m in university and i m a part of a couple different club society we occasionally all go out and eat together i ve quickly realised that i ve been very anxious when eating food on a table with other woman there particularly the one i m meeting for the first time or the one i want to leave an impression on i have a bit of a short beard and one of my fear is that food will drip down and get stuck in my beard and those woman will notice it before i can clean it or it might just get stuck and they ll silently judge me for it and not tell me it s there i ve become great at conversation overtime from previously being very introverted and shy but asap food is served and everyone start eating i switch from being that casual fun guy to a scared and shy introvert who keep wiping his face after every bite of food he gulp down p s interestingly my fear isin t there when i m with guy or if i m with woman i m already close to would love to hear you guy opinion on how to tackle it and if you guy have faced any similar fear xx

they can get so unbelievably scary i do everything i can to avoid it happening because people give me 0 sympathy about it sometimes i start shaking breathing heavily heart thumping hard and a raging headache people have made fun of me for when i shake i genuinely believe i will have a heart attack or honestly it s going to be in public where no one ha sympathy for me and they will be moreso threatened of me and they will take me out i just know it s coming

i m on sertraline for anxiety while it ha lowered it it ha increased background anxiety even when i m going nothing it suck and it ha caused me to have a floppy noodle male when having sex which suck even more for me and her

there s this guy that i like and i know he like me i ve never had a boyfriend before and i ve never had my first kiss so sex is a big step for me however he had a girlfriend of five year they were high school sweetheart they broke up two year ago because she left him for another girl she s pansexual he knew that she wa pansexual but still she left him they probably had lot of sex if they didn t have sex i d be extremely surprised i just feel so insecure that i m such a novice i m not going to be good at it and i feel bad that he is going to have to teach me so much stuff

i really just need advice right now it s current am where i live and i ve yet to sleep i suffer from emetophobia the fear of throwing up if anyone need context my anxiety usually at night come forth it always wake me up but i wake up with panic attack because i feel nauseous similarly like tonight i m losing sleep because i feel nauseous despite me being so exhausted i m scared to sleep my stomach doesn t roll if i try to drink or eat something it doesn t go away i m on med too i just want some advice i m tired of losing sleep and worrying people because of physical anxiety and a phobia for more context i could eat a spoonful of something and it didn t make my stomach roll at all it sat fine there yet i feel nauseous and have slight pain right now it feel a if i m hungry but my anxiety is making me avoid that i don t know what to do i m very afraid right now

some day i just have tiny panic attack for no reason is that common also i have very high social anxiety so it s very frickin hard to make friend and trust when your constantly thinking oh there talking about me when there not or when i want to really to them but i can t because there s like this thing holding me back and i get stressed just for being by people i have no friend and to top it all off i suffer from depression and suicidal thought

recently i started dealing with a lot of stress which ha turned into me feeling panicked off and on throughout the day during my time of feeling panic i get this trouble with my breathing which feel incredibly terrible it is scary when it happens because it feel like i m breathless and like my breathing pattern mess up i wa wondering ha this happened to anyone else if so is it okay if i could ask a few question about it i d love to have some insight or more information on this situation

i m m and i have been single my whole life because my anxiety around girl a a young kid up till now i have always had this anxiety towards girl i like and this fear ha stopped me from pursuing girl also i get anxious in crowd or party which i try to avoid at all cost when i go any place where there are a lot of girl like the gym i get really anxious if cute girl are around me i always hope none of them talk to me because i will get anxious and it may show it always feel like i m battling myself to look normal and not anxious to minimize my anxiety i avoid eye contact with any girl i would say i m a handsome guy and i have been told that all my life by several people i m also confident in myself for the most part i think but despite that i still have this anxiety towards girl and the thing is i know the way to cure this is to start talking to girl but the fear is too much for me it ha got to the point were i m starting to accept that i may be single for the rest of my life another thing is my parent always ask me if i m gay they always say how am i handsome and don t get girl i always tell them it because i have anxiety but they still don t understand this just needed to vent thanks for reading

how do i get past this i don t have panic attack i m diagnosed with bpd and never considered anxiety to be it own issue just a component of my bpd but i think my anxiety independent of bpd need it own attention i m scared to seek help i m scared a therapist who specializes in anxiety will stigmatize me for having bpd and tell me that s just your bpd i m anxious my bos won t give me time off work for therapy i m anxious i ll need anxiety med and it ll impair my function

i smoked for the first time in month and now i m freaking out and idk what to do edit i m all good now blocked out the stress for a little bit now getting food with the boy

so because of my anxiety i have this big fear of being alone i m afraid that i will lose my mind and hurt myself or something i constantly surround myself with people and when my partner leaf town i have family stay with me i feel like this is kind of becoming a problem because i m never facing my anxiety alone so when i m alone driving or doing anything else alone i panic

this is nothing new for me and it doesn t really have a chance to come out now because i ve been out of school for about four year and i don t really go out in public much at all but from elementary school to high school i think it even happened when i wa attempting college too when walking down stair my leg would get so stiff that it wa impossible to walk down the stair properly and i wa always scared that everyone could see how my leg were bugging out like that and it made me even more anxious even if no one wa in the stairwell with me or even just one other person it would happen one time i got a friend he wa and i m to carry me down the stair because my leg were just not having it also all my life i have day where i felt like i wa just floaty and floating outside of my body i also felt like whenever i felt this way something bad would happen to me or someone else this feeling last all day and maybe even until the next day i don t know what this is i know other people have this too so could you tell me what it is also also several time a day i ll get really nervous and my heart will feel like it jumped and i ll have a scared feeling for a few second today i even had a weird small pain in my stomach that went a long with it but went away some second after my heart jumped and the scared feeling went away the tummy pain ha never happened before also also also i sometimes wake up feeling really nervous and scared even though nothing ha happened sorry for this really long post i tried to space it out so it would be a le intimidating big wall of text

hi there i am someone who suffers from health anxiety in the past month it started the day after two terrible thing happened to me my dog who i wa very close with passed away and i found out that i tested positive for covid so quite the shellshock to say the least the night after that i had a panic attack which really scared me since i had never previously had one that night i wa in the hospital for a few hour and aside from the fact i had covid the doctor told me i wa completely fine after that night i would go on to get a blood test and visit the doctor multiple time needle to say that everything came back fine nothing bad wa found in my blood and despite having multiple odd feeling the doctor said i wa fine and basically confirmed i wa suffering from a form of health anxiety meaning i would feel like something is wrong with me but in reality i wa just fine around the fourth visit he recommended i see a counselor and suggested getting a neurologist exam to remove all fear i have been seeing a counselor for a few week now and the earliest neurologist meeting is in may a for my physical symptom i currently have a pin and needle feeling in the back of my head and my neck ha been feeling a bit stiff over the course of the last month i ve had other feeling such a pin in my left hand rough skin emphasized feeling in all sort of part in my body and other feeling i probably forgot about i m posting here because it seems like a welcoming community and i want to share my experience with others who have suffered similarly and hopefully get some reassurance for my self from others i just need an outlet to cope to because i hate constantly bother others i live with for reassurance either way thank you for reading and for those out there that are suffering just know that you re not alone and you will all live long happy healthy and successful life and your pain will soon pas god bless you all p for those wondering yes i got over covid

not sure if this is the right sub to post but wasn t sure where to go really i wouldn t say that i feel anxious but i m what people call a worry wart if there s something i can worry about even if it s maybe very small i will still worry about it i m worried about multiple thing currently my dog leg that s hurting a pain i have in my lower jaw finding a new job etc i will have thought about these sort of thing and on the surface they don t seem like much but then i start to think about them more and more and i start to worry even more until i start getting scared of panicking sometimes like i have had this pain in my jaw for a few day now i m assuming it s because i haven t worn my retainer for the full time i m supposed to the past few night my mind think that but i also start worrying it might be another cavity and i ll have to go to the dentist which is the worst thing for me but then i think hang on i ve gone to them for similar stuff like this before and it wasn t a cavity but what if it is this time you see the problem i m having even though i ll try and think about it logically my brain always make up some sort of way to worry about stuff that might not even need that much thought this is half a rant and half me looking for advice i worry so much in my life and i hate it i know i won t stop worrying but can anyone give me some advice to maybe worry le

so ive came to the conclusion that i actually have anxiety and imsonia have all the sympthons for anxiety and i cant sleep for shit im can be dead tired and i go lay down and 0 min later im still up ive spent plenty of night up for hour trying to sleep ive had a few night where im asleep but i feel half awake ill be sleep but i feel like im still awake ive been avoiding seeing a doctor because my family is pretty judgemental but i really feel like i need sometype of help it getting in the way of my life i cant sleep the lack of sleep ha me weak it making my work life hell because im fatigue then my anxiety always me over thinking and feelomg weird in when im in social setting

i wish there wa a reddit thing for friendship breakup but since november 0 i ve been repeatedly crushed by a now ex best friend who i never wanted to let go of it s my fatal flaw forgiving ppl who don t deserve it i always get bitten in the as and never learn from it the manipulative people in my life have torn my down over and over and bc i m literally a fucking doormat i don t want to explain everything with this specific friend but part of what keep hurting me is that i see picture and am reminded of good memory we ve had and all of a sudden i miss them or i ll see picture from when i wa happy and i m brought to tear over the fact that i m convinced it s all my fault i wish i could delete my social medium and throw my phone into another galaxy but sometimes thing like snapchat and tik tok make me happy so then i don t do that why am i like this why do people walk away from me so easily why do i let those people in just for them to walk out again

idk if it wa selective mutism or not i never got a diagnosis wasn t even suggested to get tested for it partially bc i don t think people understood how serious and debilitating it wa but i used to have severe anxiety around certain people mainly teacher or subject talking about myself or asking for help were big one for me to the point where i literally couldn t speak like people don t really seem to get it when i say this because it s one thing being shy or nervous to speak for me i know how that feel like if i m just nervous i just feel very uncomfortable this wasn t that when talking about certain subject or talking to certain people i would have this very uncomfortable and sometimes very painful physical symptom where i don t know how else to describe it other than it felt like someone wa stepping on my throat like my throat wa closed shut tight i found it hard to breathe not in a hyperventilating kind of way more like in a i m choking right now please help me way i would start hyperventilating if i wa forced to speak for whatever reason trying to force myself to speak would make me lose air lightheaded and i would start breathing hard trying to take in more air since i wa literally choking on nothing basically or worse i d quickly break into an anxiety attack and start cry if i kept trying to force the problem even harder to breathe i felt faint close to passing out so many time then it wa not even funny i m not looking for a diagnosis i wa just wondering if anyone can relate idk

sometimes when i start to fall asleep it s like i get trapped in my dream and can not wake up the dream are usually a very uncomfortable or weird situation sometimes even terrifying i normally feel dizzy and disoriented in the dream once im finally able to wake up im out of breath and panicking im not sure what to make of these event but it mess with my sleep when it occurs i can t fall asleep for a while until i calm my brain down

i m worrying about having schizophrenia psychosis every day it s gotten to the point where i can t do normal stuff without thinking about my sanity whenever i talk to someone i always over analyze conversation i feel like people don t like me or make fun of me and it make me question my sanity too i do overthink my own behavior a well i always feel like i m behaving like a crazy person and people just don t want to tell me im crazy which make me think im delusional and the cycle go on with almost everything hell i even feel like a crazy person writing this post i d been to psychiatrist before and he told me i have ocd and anxiety but i just can t believe it i don t feel like a normal person and i m tired of this am i really going crazy if not then what the hell am i supposed to do to stop this if u find my text confusing then sorry english is my second language and i m still learning

i ve been eating the same food every meal for month now bc everything else make me want to throw up and cry this is pretty normal for me so i never thought to bring it up with my psychiatrist and recently i ve been able to eat other food a well but when i sat at the table this morning i found everything repulsive even my go to food this usually only happens when my anxiety is really bad but i feel pretty ok rn so i don t know why i can t eat is this common with anxiety disorder

tw somewhat mention of blood and scarring idk if this is linked to anxiety or whatnot but i constantly find myself picking at my lip and finger especially when i get really anxious i hate how it s left my lip scarred and bloody but i just can t seem to stop i ve tried putting chapstick on to prevent peeling so i wouldn t pick but it never lasted more than a couple week also my finger look pretty bad when i wa younger i would rip the white part of my fingernail off but now i just rip the surrounding skin until they bleed and scab i mean everytime i feel anxious and nervous i keep my hand together and in front of me which eventually lead to me picking at my finger i already have pretty bad social anxiety so the thought of people being able to see my awful hand and lip make me feel worse man something is really wrong with me tbh

like i can t even focus on anything my mind is always racing overthinking and obsessing this is especially annoying right now because i have my final exam coming up real soon and i need to work but i can t concentrate i hate the way i act around people i am so awkward i don t even speak just awkwardly nod whenever someone talk to me and whenever i do talk some dumb shit come out of my mouth it seems like i have started to isolate myself more and more from people and i am always moody people have started to catch on saying that i always look sad tired among other not very nice thing whenever someone asks me if i am okay i just lie and say yes nod my head awkwardly or make up some excuse i wish i could tell someone about my problem in depth but really i don t know what i would say and honestly no one would actually care and i don t blame them everyone ha their own shit going on and i don t want to bother anyone with my problem my own mother ha started to catch on to my moodiness and she ha started to yell at me and everything cause of the way i am acting i don t even think i am doing anything wrong i m just not talking and i want to be left alone i wish i could tell her but again i don t know what i would say i don t know how she would take it and i don t want to stress her out anxiety really suck i hate using these thing a an excuse cause i just want to get on with my life like everyone else

ok going to start with i had originally posted this on a different account but i don t really want this to be traced back to me from anyone i may potentially know who may stumble upon that other account there s way too much that i could say so i will just say a few thing i think i ve been suffering from anxiety for a long time and it s pretty crippling to my social interaction and the choice i make i miss out on a lot of stuff because of it and tend to have self destructive behavior when i make friend i have this problem where i feel like oversharing because someone is actually listening to me but due to some thing lately i ve started putting up more wall i joke around a lot and tease to distract from people actually knowing me because i think that people knowing me is really scary i ve been closing my circle and any time i speak to people i m just overwhelmingly anxious i fear that i ll say something that will make people start disliking me or finding me annoying i work at a customer service place and i get really anxious when customer start asking question i don t know the answer to or get even remotely frustrated with me i also get really anxious when a bigger group of customer come in and it just feel really embarrassing i have a really hard time with phone call too it really stress me out when i have to call someone or talk to like authority figure on the phone i wish i could be able to fix it and make it easier to leave my house or message people etc i just want to be able to exist without being afraid you know

i know for a fact i have an anxiety disorder i ve been diagnosed i ve been taking med for it for year now but a of recent thing feel like they re getting worse the more i find way to manage it the more it feel like my body throw a new curveball at me i also have been wondering about adhd which i display a lot of symptom of and have been looking into getting a diagnosis for that i have chronic pain and fatigue been dealing with it since i wa and i m 9 now so it s mostly manageable but i feel like since i conquered that and know how to avoid flare ups and treat them my body is coming up with new way to torment me now i ve found that whenever i get really stressed or anxious i itch and not just a normal run of the mill itch it s an insatiable deep crawling sensation that is impossible to ignore i get it the worst on my foot i scratch and scratch and scratch and it never get better and when it s really bad i m left with cut and scrape from scratching so much it s so emotionally and physically painful it hurt so badly because i know it s not real and that my brain is doing this to me but i still feel it and it won t go away i m literally having a breakdown right now because of it i m making this post because i just need to scream into the void and i want to know if anybody else deal with this if you do you re not alone i just don t know how to make it better i hate this feeling so much this all started btw because i couldn t figure out a chest harness for myself i don t know how to make it stop and it s driving me nut

about the fact that you need to put your sex life at risk temporarily or sometimes permanently r pssd in order to feel mentally stable i hope one day they can make an antidepressant for anxiety and depression that doe not cause sexual side effect it would be a true life saver for me it suck when you value both that you need to really outweigh the pro and con tldr buspar suck

i m talking to my psych on monday and i want to do some research into what might work for me i have frequent mild panic attack infrequent but still kind of like once a week once every week severe panic attack and constant anxiety i ve tried a bunch of anxiety med but haven t really found any that worked for me however i haven t tried any in year so there s a chance i ve grown a i wa about during most of my trial and it s been a good year since then so what are were your favorite thanks

my anxiety ha recently gotten so bad that it consumes me at time i m not able to stop shaking my blood pressure is suffering from it and thought of impending doom are constant it s hard for me to focus on anything i got back from the doctor for anxiety a couple day ago and my bp wa 0 90 i got my bp checked yesterday and a i did i started panicking and my bp shot up 0 something i had to calm myself down and luckily it went back down to around i have to go get it checked again today and i know i m gon na panic again i hate living like this i feel like i m suffering i need someone to help me through this who get it i need to know that it s just gon na be okay and that i still have a chance in life

your brain is lying to you you matter your best is good enough even on the bad day you are amazing you have so much to offer this world

i haven t really worked a stable job in a while and now i ve got two of them i ll be starting both this week and i just have the jitter i wa a different person year ago so i didn t get a nervous but now i m feeling overwhelmed because i for one i don t socialize with people ever and i havent been truly employed for such a long time the job aren t hard job but it s a real establishment and a bos and co worker and i m just nervous i don t want to mess up because i need these job if i want to move out i just want everything to go right

im going to university with this childhood friend of mine the thing is i don t know how to socialize any further than just a small talk that lead no where and i never know what to talk about even with them and they present me people that are nice but i just don t feel comfortable with them i try to talk to the people in my classroom in the different class but never go any further than that every time i talk to someone i feel like i m annoying them or that my mere pressense irritates them i don t know what to do to expand my social group to people i have common interest in both in hobby and in the career i m at

hey so i feel cringe posting this and will likely delete but sometimes just venting and writing thing out is rlly calming and therapeutic this is my first post here but i ve lurked for a few year now and always read other people s story when im feeling down and alone which help sometimes background before getting into this i have gad and major depressive disorder and have been on ssri since 0 my dad side of the family all tend to have the same issue just on a way le of a scale i am awful at articulating my thought and it s insanely frustrating just a head up before getting into the incoherent vent post i m just gon na be listing a bunch of different thing that have been bothering me i am soon to be i am absolutely petrified of turning 0 and i have 0 accomplishment in life i still live with my parent i work a shitty job paying hr i have 0 motivation or drive to want to pursue anything like a better job meeting new people getting into a relationship etc i sit in my dark dimly lit room all day and play game watch twitch stream all of my friend are moving on and having kid and getting their own place and embracing adulthood with open arm i seem to be the only one that is incapable of making this transition i want to be a kid again i want the simpler time i hate responsibility and expectation i m immature and dumb and don t want to grow up i have a shitty jealous easily angered petty personality that i wa also blessed enough to obtain from my dad side of the family i have never met someone with a personality a petty and insecure a mine ex so i have this friend that applied for a government job that would be really good for her and she d be making good money this is obviously a great thing and i m happy for her but i would be lying if i said i wasn t kinda hoping she got turned down we both currently work shitty job and suffer the same money work struggle i think i just don t want to be left behind and feel like i m alone in my struggle i feel so shitty that i m even thinking this way i also have an ego that i rlly shouldn t have considering im an ugly short bald year old that peaked in highschool idk if it s undiagnosed narcissism or what but i know something is wrong because of this i am most of the time an awful friend i ve gotten better over the year because i gained some self awareness before though i would burn a lot of bridge i wa getting into argument with irl friend and internet friend weekly man i used to be such a bully to my little brother growing up too and i cringe every time i think about it im incredibly grateful every day that i wa able to gain self awareness and a want to change i have anxiety attack and sink into deep hole of depression when faced with the realization i have to work a 9 0 hour work week cuckjob for another 0 year i used to watch twitch stream a an escape but now i can t even do that anymore without having an anxiety attack that i ll never get to live the easy luxurious life that they do wake up whenever they want go to work whenever they want do w e they want for hour and then log off and go do fuck all they can take off whenever they want without the worry of being fired all while making more in year than i will ever make in lifetime of busting my as i understand i m describing like the top of twitch streamer but still i have really awful self esteem and have had for a long a i could remember i used to hate getting picture taken a a kid and would constantly try to hide my face it became a running gag in my friend group that i would never take picture it wa to a point where i wa having anxiety attack just seeing picture of myself there are time when i start to feel better about my appearance but then ill see a picture of myself and immediately get reminded that i m fuckin nosferatu i genuinely think i m incredibly below average and if it wasn t for the fact that i am addicted to working out i might just be the most undesirable man on the planet i would put myself in bottom 0th percentile in look i do think i have some degree of body dysmorphia and it s especially bad right now because im in a panic y state so i am probably overreacting a little about my appearance i ve always had some social anxiety growing up but it wa maintainable and didn t rlly stop me from doing most thing i wanted to do but there wa an incident in 0 that just made it skyrocket and it ha been progressively getting worse since quite frankly i think i am just doomed to suffer i genuinely do not see a happy ending future for me i am a walking abomination of every negative character trait imaginable that doesn t deserve to have good friend i don t even want to have kid because idk for certain if i just won t day get tired of it all and shoot my shot if u will i wouldn t want to have kid growing up without their dad i also don t want to potentially pas down to them the shitty mental health gene that i have and have them go through everything i have mentally bc it suck and i would want a better life for them honestly there s so much more fucking shit that i could complain about regarding myself but this is already long enough don t feel obligated to respond to this i ve already started to feel a little better just from typing it this is the th night in a row i ll be up till am bc anxiety attack keeping me from falling asleep oh yeah and reminder that this is all while still taking ssri s i do not want to imagine what my mental state would be without them tl dr money work growing up age look self esteem personality social anxiety it s all freakin shit and make me depressed and anxious

went in for problem i won t disclose had blood drawn and they had it sent in my symptom just keep getting worse and it s making me fear getting the dreaded cancer call back i m making it worse for myself by googling symptom after symptom illness after illness treatment after treatment and it s filling me with more dread i can t stop shaking i can t sleep i don t know what to do this is the worst attack i ve had in a long time and all i want is to go back day to before my symptom appeared so i can feel normal again and not have to fear the worst i don t know what else to say i m just so scared of what might be and i m just psyching myself out and making it worse i wouldn t be surprised if my symptom are getting worse because of the anxiety i want my doctor to see me on the weekend and i want to be comforted i don t want to die i don t want to go through treatment i m afraid of medication i m just so fucking scared right now and i just want it all to calm down i m afraid to call people i m afraid to wake up family but i don t know where to go or what to do

hi everyone in the past few year that i have been living alone a a student i noticed myself falling into period of time where i would not leave the house alone it s not a if i don t enjoy going outside i live in vancouver and there are some truly beautiful day here where the sunlight make this city breathtaking my issue isn t a fear of going outside it s more of a fear of the people i ll encounter and how they may judge me i ve always struggled with depression and low self esteem i ve always felt nervous about other people looking at me i avoid leaving the house alone unless it s necessary and when i do it s usually at night i ve even had point in the past where i ve drunk alcohol to make myself feel le nervous about leaving the apartment for grocery i usually don t make eye contact when i m alone outside and keep my eye focused ahead or on the ground why do other people scare me so much when i m on my own i can leave if i m with friend but on my own i always get nervous and procrastinate until nighttime when fewer people are out i think i just feel safer inside because other people aren t there to see me or place judgment i m fortunate enough that my current bos allows me to work from home so unless i need to leave the house i usually won t i even try to get most of my grocery via amazon so i can minimize the chance of going outside i feel like i want to hide in here and not think about anything i don t even want to look at myself i wa wondering if there are other people who feel this way too is there a name for what i m experiencing am i just lazy i just want to know how to feel better

title i am currently looking at getting onto med for my anxiety and am exploring option for telehealth my goal is to get on them a soon a possible along with going to a therapist to engage in cbt doe anyone here have suggestion for solid telehealth platform ideally i would not have to wait that long to see a doctor so that i can receive med in a timely manner and i do not have to pay an arm and a leg for the appointment with that being said i am ok with spending a little extra if it mean that i am able to get into an appointment quicker i have been looking at cerebral hims and other various telehealth service which i can not remember at this moment doe anyone have suggestion on one that can provide timely service i am ok with paying money for a monthly appointment if it mean that i can get med but ideally i would get on med a soon a possible and then go to an irl mental health counselor and get med from them thanks

last year i had a mental breakdown in my very first apartment i got way too overwhelmed and i panicked the anxiety episode lasted month and i couldnt function well today i made it through the night my first day back no anxiety or anything

every time i talk to somebody outside of my house and can relate to somebody or have thing in common with people i just want to curl up and cry almost every time i meet somebody irl i freak out and say i never want to see them again and if i don t do that i act distant the next time i see them i only have online friend and having friend making friend irl is scary i m and a half and everyone say thing like your going to be getting a job soon but if i cant even make friend how am i suppose to get a job

hello everyone i am currently on a trip for spring break college senior with friend and really struggling first a little background though i am now but have struggled with anxiety on and off my entire life it started with separation anxiety probably not being okay going to daycare or anything of the sort even with my older brother just because i couldn t stand being away from my parent i also would get hysterical if they left for a trip etc i also would be frantic and cry at the end of the school day in elementary school because i worried my parent wouldn t be there to pick me up a i got older this morphed into more health anxiety i also faint around needle so i have a big fear of fainting and then into panic disorder in high school diagnosed by my therapist i have seen a number of therapist off and on but never gone on any medication for anxiety my parent are super supportive of therapy but have always been more skeptical of med for mental health i also had a really hard time going to college even though it wa only an hour away because i got majorly homesick and struggled with adjustment disorder i eventually did adjust and now totally love my school but it took me a solid semester to overcome by homesickness fast forward to present i have noticed i get really nervous for trip that are somewhere unfamiliar to me and where i don t have one of my safe people with me my parent or my boyfriend i have amazing friend who are caring and supportive but for some reason they don t fall into my safe category like my parent or boyfriend do also just a sidenote but i had a generally happy childhood and have a great relationship with my parent for whatever relevance that may have i have huge anxiety leading up to trip and then also when i arrive and it tends to be crippling if i don t have a safe person there right now i am in mexico for day on spring break with three of my friend and i feel tremendously awful and sad like not necessarily panicky but just really deeply sad and like i want nothing more than to go home and hug my loved one i am trying to do more research and it seems like this could be a separation anxiety type issue in place where i feel comfortable hometown college town etc i am totally happy doing thing alone being independent of my safe people so it isn t an all the time thing but it is making travel really not fun for me and i honestly just want nothing more than to go home any advice would be great i am currently in therapy cbt general talk therapy mashup and will be bringing this up with my therapist but i would really love any and all suggestion for both tackling this immediately and trying to enjoy my trip and for way to think about this when i talk with my therapist i know this is a bit rambling so sorry and thank you

long rant from a person with a diagnosed anxiety disorder tl dr at the bottom got yelled at by my bos today it s my first week working here someone ordered room service he said his food wa cold so i returned to the kitchen to ask for another dish to be made and i d hand deliver it myself so it would be piping hot i wanted to prevent this becoming a complaint so wanted to deal with it quickly returned to the kitchen manager wa sorting out further order with two other member of staff he wa in a hurry to leave so needed the order out he started barking and i mean barking order at me and i said one sec just going to ask the chef to got interrupted got told he didn t give a flying fuck that it could wait another hour and that i wa being the worst employee he had ever had a i wa being argumentative even though i never responded to him after my initial sentence of wait a sec bear in mind he s lost two member of staff since i started two week ago due to them finding work elsewhere and all i wa trying to do wa keep up customer satisfaction said resident left a negative review on the hotel website saying that a nice girl me had respectfully answered his complaint but upon phoning down to add something to his meal the manager told him that he would have to wait and he didn t care if the resident left a bad review and encouraged him to do so and when i finally came up with his food he apologised profusely he said from the attitude he got on the phone that he belief he got me in trouble and that he wa really sorry so in his review he wrote that i wa nice and the manager wa off putting and rude another employee stated that he told the resident he didn t give a fuck and had better thing to do with his time than chase after lazy people who couldn t come down to the restaurant for their dinner i never specified what happened to the resident and simply denied that i had gotten into trouble i just apologised for the long wait said everything wa fine the kitchen wa just backed up and left anyways i get paid minimum wage to not get my break minimum wage to get yelled at and told if i don t get my break then you don t either isn t fair especially considering i d been there for hour already and he had been there for 0 minute and wa leaving in an hour this entire incident resulted in me suppressing a panic attack for the remaining hour of my shift so when i left the building i broke down in tear and my mom had to pick me up off the ground don t suppress panic attack people it ll come back around honestly just not cut out for this my anxiety make me overthink thing so i can t even tell whether there is anything i could ve done differently here i just want to cry and i have work again in a few hour and he s going to be there and i m just upset i m never going to get rid of my anxiety disorder he just kindly reminds me every day tl dr got yelled at by my manager for trying to prevent an issue becoming a complaint it became one because of him and i got blamed for it get paid minimum wage work long hour and get no break can t quit because i m already a disappointment

i am on 0 mg of trintellix 0 mg of buspar twice a day and 0 mg of trazadone and after doing some research this combo might give me serotonin syndrome and trintellix interacts with trazadone so idk if he s tryna kill me or he doesn t know what he s doing or if i m just over reacting lmao

a lot of post and answer here are about health anxiety which i don t have or social anxiety which i do have but isn t the problem most of the time i ve had really bad anxiety for a long a i can remember and it s only starting to get better now that i ve been taking antidepressant for about a month but i just don t understand where the anxiety is coming from and even what it is about i don t know what i m afraid of i couldn t tell you what i m stressed out about recently my therapist told me my anxiety come from an obsessive disorder but not like ocd he explained it wa only mental but i still don t get it so i guess my question is doe anybody else here have that kind of anxiety and could you explain it to me it just drive me crazy to have my life ruined by something that doesn t make any sense

for starter i ve suffered from ocd my entire life thing such a having to touch thing with both hand in the same spot counting making sure the volume is on even number hair pulling etc etc i ve never had the physical side effect of anxiety though from what i understand ocd is classified a an anxiety disorder two month ago i had my first ever panic attack after smoking too much weed and my life ha been hell ever since it wa the first time i ve experienced panic such a the burning in the chest the sinking feeling in the stomach the fear that something is wrong the problem is that ever since that panic attack started i ve been stuck in a state of panic and my brain is doing it obsessively constantly using the panic neural pathway in the brain this is what i figured and how my psychiatrist explained it also so i ve basically been stuck in a never ending panic attack for two month and it ha ruined my physical and mental health i have a rush of adrenaline and sinking feeling in my stomach every second for no reason at all my brain is just very obsessive an it keep activating the panic button i can t control it either it won t stop no matter what i do my mouth is always dry and i feel on edge and over stimulated my joint hurt all the time and the worst thing is my ability to heal ha been drastically shut down my joint and muscle don t heal from wear and tear anymore so i ve been bed ridden i ve tried ssri benzos antipsychotic etc and nothing ha helped at all some thing may help me cope and deal with it better but nothing stop my brain from constantly panicking i ve been looking into assisted way to end my life a i can t imagine the rest of my life being in a permanent panic attack this is no way to live anyways i need to know if anyone ha dealt with something similar and if there s any way for me to get out of constant fight or flight thank you tldr my brain learned how to panic and it s obsessively hitting the panic button for no reason

m f we are currently dating for like month i mean we had sex timesim sure that i do love her a lot and she doe to but i don t want to get in a relationship now cuz i have trust issue it not about her i swear to god but i mean i dont want to think of her in a bad way i dont want to think that she is sleeping with a random dude at this moment i think she is cheating on me for no reason d even though we are not in a relationship and we didn t talk about it actually i am just jealous or have trust issue and i dont want to to make her day bad i want her to feel happy but am not sure about her i mean i had the thought that she is playing with me at the same time i feel like she rly love me and of course i didnt say that to her cuz i am her friend or her lover i meant i don t think that is ok to say that when you re not in a relationship even if we were together i wont say that or think of her like that with how to deal with that how to make it work

i am the definition of a failure i have mental diagnosis no job or education have money problem and poor health due to all the stress of life i have no idea at all how i can change my life so i become one quite normal person with normal success in life im 0 and feel so behind in life

so last night i wa up for hour trying to reset my sleep schedule since i had been going to sleep around am and waking up around pm i still wasn t that tired last night around 0 pm so i smoked some weed a i usually do every night i started hallucinating while making my bed seeing hand grab for me when i tucked the blanket it i tried to convince myself it wasn t real but i wa really freaking out so i went up stair and tried to just chill and find something to eat at this point my mind is racing and i can t think straight and i m wondering what is wrong with me and that s when i realized my heart wa racing like beating out of my chest i quickly pulled out my stopwatch to take my pulse because lately when i get anxious my heart rate get to about 0 my whole body is shaking and i m trying to count every beat for second but i got to second and my count wa already at 0 the stopwatch on my phone looked like it glitched and my knee went weak i thought i wa going to pas out so i freaked out and ran to my dad for him to take my pulse just in case i wa just buggin and just thought my heart rate wa crazy nope it wa resting at a i laid in my dad bed for about 0 minute shaking and cry i couldn t even get my breathing under control because i wa shaking so bad i couldn t voluntarily move needle to say i m going back on anxiety med sleeping more and never smoking weed again and i m gon na start seeing a cardiologist

so yesterday i had plan to go skating with a friend and we drive there everything is good and we re sitting in the car waiting to go in all of the sudden the overwhelming urge to cry just come over me and i start sobbing two second prior i wa laughing totally fine it took me a half an hour to be able to go inside luckily my friend is amazing and super understanding but what should i do in that situation any tip at all on how to control myself would be much appreciated

my anxiety manifest itself in many way and this is one form of it i would stand in front of the mirror and just feel like guilty for not being better not contributing more not being more positive not being a better friend when in reality i do those thing anyone else relate to this feeling

i have a constant paranoia of having rabies normally i can distract myself and just not think about it but if i get reminded of it i m worrying about having it i don t think i ve ever bitten by a wild animal and definitely not one that had rabies plus my country hasn t had a rabies case in year the last one being a dead fox found in the wood i have no idea why i keep worrying about it but i do and i keep wondering whether it s related to anxiety or something else

for the past month i ve been ill and every er urgent care and pediatrician say that nothing is wrong with me after several trip to my school psychologist because of anxiety i ve deduced that these are probably long covid symptom cool i guess since the monday before last i ve been waking up with headache that don t go away i immediately started getting anxious and started researching my symptom immediately google say it s brain cancer great i m and all i ve been thinking about since this started wa how i m going to die soon they ve checked all the problem area except in my head i want to get an mri but the oncoming medical bill are looming over my head i m also scared of the result on one hand i could have a tumor cancer that might kill me and on the other hand i could be wasting everyone s time my pediatrician suck and will probably just say it s anxiety which is probably the secondary issue not the primary one i m just so tired and so scared i feel like i have no one to talk to and it s consuming my life
