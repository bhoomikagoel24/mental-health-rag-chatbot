i posted on the self harm sub a to why you can just look at my profile and you ll see it amp x 00b have a great day everyone

i cant eat over 00 calorie ori feel horrible and i lost kg in a few week but my parent didnt notice until recently now they scream at me wheneber i dont eat and threaten to kill me and throw sfuff at me im sitting in a cornee cry afzer my dad threw his bag at me and called me a disgusting skinny bitch my mom is now saying she ha arrhythmia because of my made up problem i have mo one to talk to i have no friend and feel like just killing myself

i am so low on energy that i don t even have word enough for this post i can not finish grad school and the job i m qualified to do i hate it i also can not talk frankly with anybody now given that i have suicidal tendency right now and that sound like emotional blackmail to everyone else if i express my wish also if i were to continue living it would be an embarrassment living a that middle aged woman who wanted to khs i m tired i don t want to fake anymore and i don t think i m even good at faking it either people can tell this is a sad loser

why should i live i m gon na die anyways and i ve tried everything to be happy hobby job everything seems menial not to mention literally no one love me my friend have left me since i couldn t open out my shell and my family and extended family are abusive the only side that wasn t my uncle died year back it s hard to swallow but literally no one care if i did death doesn t even scare me it s just a eternal sleep that ll come and snatch me anyways so why bother and i mean this genuinely those around me seem so pleased but it just don t feel the same therapy and all just doesn t cut it and med only get me high

it ha almost been month since i lost my nephew more like my brother though i wa at the time and he wa he wa the person that meant the absolute most to me we have both struggled with suicide our entire life i used to be a very emotional and empathetic person and i tried to make everyone happy i am no longer that in fact in the past year leading up to the event i had slowly lost my emotion empathy my ambition and pretty much everything that make a human human but when it happened i lost everything i wa and am no longer the person i wa i want to be happy again i want to care about people i want to care about music again i want to care about car again i want my hobby back most of all i want him back and what we had we were the same person our emotion the way we thought our diet everything affected our body the same way we thought about thing the exact same way our reaction were the same the thing we loved were the same for the most part our depression wa the same the thing that haunted u were the same the thing we were scared of were the same we were the same person i don t really know how to go on without him i have people that care about me but it doesn t matter they aren t him i don t even know why i m writing this this won t change anything i just wa listening to music he used to love and i wa finally able to cry a bit it s gone now though my feeling are gone again my life feel fake now

yep at the age of le than i m already considering suicide i ve been depressed for about a year or two already and i ve thought about km but it wa always just that a thought until about a month ago maybe two month i thought about my life seriously and i realised there were extremely few thing that made me happy happy enough to keep me alive that is i decided that it might just be better without me in the equation i ve been obsessing over it and i just don t know why i have a good few reason to do it but i don t know why i keep thinking about it all the time i don t even know why i m telling y all this but i just am

i have no friend that i enjoy spending time with i m about to go through my second messy breakup in the past two year the last of which got me diagnosed with ptsd my family ha done nothing but ignore me emotionally for my entire life and i fucking want out i m live with my parent because i m a minor and have lived in the country very far away from people for year now i don t really have any dream or ambition and i have had depression and anxiety for a long a i can remember i m tired of everything and i just want it to stop i m behind in schoolwork and i m just recovering from an antidepressant that worsened my feeling my school is online and i don t really have any option to interact with people other than my parent now that my partner is breaking up with me nothing really brings me happiness and i just feel like there s nothing i m going to do in life i don t want to go to college or really be successful all i really want to do is to find love but i m not even sure if that s a good ambition anymore especially since no one would actually stay with me i don t know what to do anymore

so i prepared everything to just end it all cause i no longer see a future for myself i literally lost all meaning in my life and i just have no idea why i live anymore everything just feel empty and i just want it to end i guess but idk why i m even writing this i guess i might want to be helped but it just feel so empty my family doesn t even have an idea that i sh i just want someone to notice to care please

i don t want to exist anymore the thought of death ha brought me a lot of peace for a while now i have friend who are incredibly important to me i love them greatly and i know that they will be perfectly fine without me i accepted my suicidal urge a few month ago and talked to them about it i don t want them to feel any form of guilt when i finally get to go and so i m trying to preemptively minimise that a much a possible i promised them each individually that i would at the very least get in touch with one of them before doing anything to give them a chance to talk to me i have even started going to therapy and promised myself that i would go for a minimum of session with a therapist whom i am comfortable with i also made myself a bucket list the whole point of it all is so that when i m gone they won t feel like they could have done more i don t want them to blame themselves for my decision i don t belong here i long for non existence it s got nothing to do with them and they shouldn t have to suffer because of me some day like today i struggle i just want to go i don t want to finish my therapy i don t want to finish my bucket list i don t want to call them i just want to be forgotten i think i m on the tail end of today spiral and i haven t sh today either which is a win i guess i just needed to write this out

anyone else having awful war anxiety if so how are you managing i like near a base so basically my situation is i m f ckef if putin decides to bomb it any advice or well word are helpful i just need to calm myself about this ww stuff please

i m so tired all the time in the physical mental and emotional sense all the time day go by doing nothing tired day of overexertion tired and sleep deprived the constant headache and facial pain doesn t help i feel like my tolerance to people is so low that i cry after i go outside my house or even more pathetically after when someone enters my room i don t know what s wrong with me nobody belief it you re so young how are you tired you need to toughen up the lab came back normal there s nothing wrong with you they don t know that every time i have to hold up this act the effect grows more and more devastating i don t blame them for it honestly i ve put up this act for such a long time that i don t think anybody really know who i am a a person i ve only allowed them to see the good side and whenever the bad side inevitably creep to the surface it inevitably end up being anticlimactically and severely misunderstood my mother try to string me along in vacation that end up draining me significantly and then she wonder why i sleep for hour every day a week after i ve given up the thing i like and i m passionate about because i feel too restless and tired to carry out anything towards a meaningful level jobless living with parent and on the cusp of a breakdown but nothing and no one that can help every night i hope i die in my sleep

my biggest emotion is anxiety i can t deal with it anymore i tried gettibg help even medicine for it but no help the pit in my stomach every single day constantly restless can t sleep well or eat well can t function at time if i didn t die from heart issue due to constant anxiety and stress i will end up killing myself just to feel some peace
