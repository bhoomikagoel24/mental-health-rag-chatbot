I'm not on my company's health insurance which could be part of the reason I answered Don't know to so many questions.

nan

I have chronic low-level neurological issues that have mental health side effects. One of my supervisors has also experienced similar neurological problems so I feel more comfortable being open about my issues than I would with someone without that experience.

My company does provide healthcare but not to me as I'm on a fixed-term contract. The mental healthcare I use is provided entirely outside of my work.

I selected my current employer based on its policies about self care and the quality of their overall health and wellness benefits. I still have residual caution from previous employers who ranged from ambivalent to indifferent to actively hostile regarding mental health concerns.

Our health plan has covered my psychotherapy and my antidepressant medication. My manager has been aware but discreet throughout. I did get negative reviews when my depression was trashing my delivery but y'know I wasn't delivering.

In addition to my own mental health issues I've known several coworkers that may be suffering and I don't know how to tell them I empathize and that I want to help.

In Russia we have mandatory medical insurance. Every employer must pay 3.6% of every employee's salary to the insurance fund like a tax. Everyone gets free healthcare at public clinics and hospitals. Some types of healthcare including mental health are still funded from the government budget but that doesn't matter it's still FREE!However this is Russia :D I don't know much about what actually happens in mental hospitals here except that a lot of young people with male in their passports use these to avoid military draft and doctors seem to help them.
