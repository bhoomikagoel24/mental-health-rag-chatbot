While mental health is a part of our insurance program the UCR is 50% of 140% of medicare which means a solo mental health practitioner who will charge in my area $150-$180 a session will only result in a $45-$60 reimbursement and thus a very high out of pocket expense. This usage of a different schedule for UCR and often the lower rate is very hard to determine before purchasing insurance even in the new health insurance exchanges.

My work is using my brain. I do it incredibly well.I make an effort to avoid diagnosis of anything mental health related because I am convinced it would only affect me negatively.

My employer is extremely easy to work with and e.g. I have enormous leeway with flex time so I could take care of myself under that umbrella but I don't know and don't have a history of bring up mental health at the workplace so I am cautious in that area.

The questions related to employer-provided health benefits are largely irrelevant to where I live Australia so I'd discount them.

These result may be a tad confusing so a summary follows.* Currently self-employed so employer is me :)* Last place of employment was amazing when I first discovered I was bi-polar and helped me as long as I was there up to and including a mental health course for the whole team (although no mention why to others which was great).* I've never had a negative reaction yet but I know others who have.* I've been very lucky with company I keep which is why my experience is largely good.

I should note one of the places my employer fails with regards to mental health is that the company-paid health insurance policy does not cover trans healthcare needs.

I've never heard of a workplace that would actually allow you to call off for mental health reasons. So many places require a doctor's note for calling off sick. It's all set up to make you feel worse if you can't just suck it up. Thanks for working to change this!!!

This survey was tough as a self-employed individual. You may wish to discard responses from self employed people for much of your analysis.

I answered based on previous job at large technical company where I was pushed out of my role within 3 months of disclosing diagnosis.I had been struggling for 3 months prior to disclosure and was incredibly relieved when finally diagnosed. Growing up in a family open about mental health and also at the end of my rope I immediately shared with management what was going on. I requested a temporary reduced workload so I could reduce anxiety. (At time I didn't know it was anxiety as took me a year to accept that the (to me) deserved stress was anxiety caused by my core diagnosis.) When disclosing I didn't deeply understand details of the state of my mental health; I simply knew I was so stressed out by having been unable to get myself to do work in three months that I couldn't juggle all that was currently on my plate.It was at this point my direct manager and I began an almost daily struggle. After working on a single project and making progress (compared to 3 months before diagnosis when management didn't even know how bad I was doing) I requested increasing my workload. This was never granted; boss said I hadn't proved myself and implied I could not be trusted.Two huge issues stick out to me from that experience:1) Company assumes things would be better and back to 100% within months. They did not understand what one goes through when figuring out meds: things at times got worse. They did not understand how long it takes until meds are figured out: mine took two years. They most certainly would not truly understand why to this day four years later despite being stable I'm in counseling every other week in addition to being on meds. Rather than supporting that it would be seen as oh I'm sorry. I was a problem to my manager because he didn't see improvements each week.2) Accomodations.- There was no option for me to reduce work temporarily to part-time (too complicated). Instead they pushed me to take disability leave. I told them that wouldn't help; they told me to double-check with care providers. That required me to see a psychologist unnecessarily as psychologist said I didn't qualify for leave. (Expensive unnecessary appointment).- The assistance I needed the most at work was understanding: I was open but my manager told me to not tell my co-worker assigned to support me. That was disasterous for colleague's stress/frustration levels. He knew something was up but was barred from asking and I was implied it was better to keep my mouth shut.- Accommodations weren't understood by even Benefits as they're not trained in mental health nor do they have people come in to assess how they're doing in supporting those with mental health issues. Should be no different than people coming in to assess for physical accessibility of the workplace. When in a meeting with my manager supervised by HR I shouldn't feel like I'm asking too much of manager when requesting he put the negative critiques on the back burner and help me figure out whether I'm doing anything right. That this didn't stop him from coming into my office that same day and putting on my dick hat to yell at me for something that wasn't even my fault (he had brought in co-worker for this yelling and turned to finish yelling at this person): FUCKING UNACCEPTABLE.While I will never return to that company and as such took the severance package I will NEVER agree with their legal reason for being unable to do the job: me being medically disqualified from this role. I was too expensive in the short term for them; I'm not worth the cost.

If a man in tech is afraid of speaking up about these things it is even worse for women in tech who are already fearful of and fighting against the stigma of incompetence.  On the other hand if a female in tech does not commiserate with her male coworkers on mental health problems she will no longer be seen as a team player. It is really a catch-22 for women in STEM.

Autism is a bitch for those living with it and living it. For the past years I've really been working hard to get myself (known) in the community. The people in the community that know can be counted on one hand. In general I'm not telling anyway unless it really matters and it would be a gain in some way or the other. Not because I don't trust the community members close to me but because I don't want to be that guy. And IMHO it doesn't and shouldn't matter but sadly some people are funky about that. Yet sometimes I wan't to tell everyone what I've been through and share my lessons learned.

This issue for me is very real at the moment. I have missed several days of work recently because of a bad reaction to a depression/anxiety drug and I hate not being able to discuss it with my boss without worrying that I will be labeled a liability.

Really manager dependent. I have had managers who work with my strengths and others who want my to work on my weaknesses which are directly tied to my mental issues.

Though it doesn't affect me (male) good job for making the Gender field a text input instead of a drop down of only two options.
