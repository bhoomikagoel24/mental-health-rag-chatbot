I was (wrongly) diagnosed clinically depressed at 12 then bipolar I at 15 and medicated for a decade until decided myself to go drug free. Since then I've never been happier. Insomnia and my insatiablility for learning and programming have always had a symbiotic  relationship.It might also bear mentioning that I'm self-employed in addition to my more traditional day job.

My employer currently does not offer any health insurance I have to get that on my own.  However at past positions I have had health insurance but no one ever mentioned mental health issues nor would I wish to discuss those with my co-workers bosses etc for fear of negative reception.

Mental health at work is not an issue if you leave work problems at work that may be easier for those of us not in a support role.

suffer from CR-PTSD so all answered based on that

Since being advised by Occupational Health that the tempo and spontenaity of the office environment was likely to have a negative effect on my mental health (I'm schizoaffective) I've been moved to 100% remote (home) working. The company have furnished a home office for me and I am only required to attend the office once a month to keep in touch

Despite the impression that several 'no' responses might give my employer has been very supportive. But then I work in health care.

When I've had a depression I was lucky to have an awesome manager who was very understanding and found a budget to pay for my therapy sessions.

People have often felt uncomfortable with my story while most of it happened a decade ago. I used to be quite open about it and have since kept it quietly tucked away. While I sometimes have waves of depression I have learned to cope with the affects.

I burnt out this year. I worked too much had too much pressure on myself from being the sole developer on a delayed project that seemed to grow in size with each week it was delayed by and worried about money a lot.I became depressed and anxious and had trouble eating sleeping and generally being myself. As my depression worsened I was regularly late for work couldn't perform as well as I should and became irritable with my colleagues.My employers response after a while was to send me private messages complaining about my lateness which only worsened the situation. I was prescribed 3 weeks off work by my doctor which my employer agreed to only to come back after to find I had been on 'statutory pay' which was roughly half of what I was expecting and was not enough to cover my rent bills AND food. This made me worse and sent me into another depression until I eventually admitted defeat gave up working and left the company. It took me months to recover and I'm now left (over 6 months after this all started) recovering from the fallout I created leaving employment with hardly any money to my name.I had previously been told by my employer that I was too young to burn out and (stupidly) trusted them. I did not feel comfortable discussing my problems with my employer because each time I was met with an attitude that I had to get myself together and ultimately given the amount of employees before me who had left the company by being fired after an altercation with the employer left me with no option but to hide it from them so I too wouldn't be fired.

My mental health issues were the direct result of the trauma from childhood abuse. Most (all?) of the Prompt-sponsored/related presentations I've seen have been about congenital mental health issues that are treatable with continued medication. For me medication only provided temporary assistance. I needed years of (continuing) therapy to deal with PTSD and related disorders (depression anxiety suicidal tendencies others). I haven't seen many in our community discussing trauma-related mental health issues but they are just as real and just as debilitating.
