it is my opinion that bad mental health is a red flag for employers and i would never bring it up.

I openly discuss my mental health struggles. I have found that doing so encourages people who also struggle to seek treatment. I'm willing to risk losing the support of people who don't understand if it helps those who understand all too well.

Just starting a new job hence the numerous I don't know selections.

The data will be skewed for self-employed people as the questions contain some bias.Having said that: being self-employed I *choose* to work for companies which want to employ *me* not just my skills but including my opinions my life-experience etc. If a potential contract/job doesn't *feel* right I prefer to not take it (and be poor) than to compromise myself.

Although my employer does everything they can to accommodate employees with mental health problems when those individuals cannot carry out any work assigned to them (even over the course of months) they appear to have no alternative but to terminate their employment. However I believe this would be the same for a physical health problem.

I work at a large university with a track record of health and wellbeing support

i'm in a country with social health care so my options are not dependant on my employer. this makes a few of the early questions less relevant than they would be for a resident of the US.

In australia all organisations of a certain size have to provide free access to a 'employee assistance program' to discuss work and personal issues.EAPs are an external provider totally confidential and anonymous (ring up andsay the name of who you work for - so they know to bill your work)  and they offer phone and face to face consults.
