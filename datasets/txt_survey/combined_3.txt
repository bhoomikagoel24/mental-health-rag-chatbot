My seniority at the company and rapport with the owners has helped me gain support for seeking help regarding my mental health as well as being able to take time off or work from home when an episode starts.However I don't feel that the company's stance on mental health is as clear as say something like vision or dental.  There's very much a stigma.

When you are an introvert people don't notice if you are depressed. Its a vicious cycle of sorts.

I've answered 'Yes' on remote working but 50% is the maximum time we're allowed.The branch of the company I work for doesn't offer any medical benefits. It's not as common in the UK as we have the NHS for the moment. There are international branches that may so I've answered 'Don't know'.

Many of these questions were difficult to answer as a self-employed person; I did my best with the available options.

I tried to answer as good as possible but I am CEO of a company so many questions don't fit very well.Also many of the questions are very US-centric in most systems healthcare is not your employers business.

One of my coworkers has mental health issues and she's open about them (eg: my enjoyment of this project may be due to my recent change in meds). I believe the response has been generally supportive. We're a very small tight-knit company.

A strong mind goes a long way. Stay strong. Take some time off to help. Its all in your head.

Would you bring up a mental health issue with a potential employer in an interview?Poignant.

I found it difficult to answer all of the questions effectively as many of them would depend on the nature of the mental health issues as some seem more socially accepted than others. For some people telling your current supervisor that you have a history of bi-polar disorder might be easier than telling a potential employer that you have a history of compulsive gambling. They might both be bits of irrelevant information (past behavior and not indicators of future behavior). However western culture pushes us to appear as capable as possible to our supervisors in pursuit of excellence in our work. Providing information that could create a negative bias seems like a more genuine and yet more risky approach to the discussion.

I have only discussed my mental illness with close family members. I feel completely uncomfortable discussing with anyone at my place of employment as I am concerned it would have negative consequences.

No benefits at this organization but my employer/direct supervisor has had positive and constructive conversations with me about physical and mental health. Supervisor offered solutions advice time/energy to get help if I ever felt that needed it. (though it would have to be at my own expense). I feel safe sharing personal info with this particular person/company but this environment is the exception rather than the norm in my 15+ years as a tech worker. I would never feel safe enough to reveal info about any mental health concerns with any previous employers in the tech industry for fear of  negative perceptions job loss performance dings etc.

I think I am very lucky in my workplace. Our CEO has a degree in psychology.

Some of these questions were difficult to answer as being self-employed they didn't all apply to me.
