I think there might be some bugs in my thought but I haven't sought treatment because they're not worse than annoying and I worry about having the label.

I think a lot of our policy is based on a situation that occurred in the past 5 years. A very public mental illness happened with a coworker that unfortunately ended negatively. It was definitely a catalyst to talking about our options but the overall sentiment of it being OK to take time off talk with your supervisors etc. has always been there. It's a great company.

Regardless of a stated lack of negative consequences for discussing mental health issues with coworkers/superiors unconscious bias is a very real thing - as long as I don't *need* to inform my co-workers my mental health issues do not need to be public knowledge.

A co-worker recently had mental health issues and my employer was very reasonable with them I don't know the full story but I do know that he was given ample time off and eased back in to the work place.

My refer to the mental health issue of depression.  I might answer differently if I was talking about a more serious issue like schizophrenia

My employer does what they can providing a wellness program and pointing it out after particularly stressful times. But the interaction between the wellness program and the medical insurance is unpleasant and finding a long-term therapist / psychiatrist covered by insurance is amazingly difficult. My current lack of active treatment is due to insurance friction more than workplace friction.

Being in Canada there are several health options that are available to Canadian citizens/perm residents for free so employers may not provide resources because they are available elsewhere. Otherwise good quiz. I hope this benefits everyone who's dealt with mental health issues in the past!
