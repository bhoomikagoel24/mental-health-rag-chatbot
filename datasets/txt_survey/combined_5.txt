I'm troubled by the way that our hiring process tends to filter out non-neurotypicals of all stripes. Competent people who act a little funny can be hard to hire.

In Germany your employer doesn't really provide mental health benefits. There's a standard and I get that but I would get the same at any other company in Germany.

fwiw I am a co founder of this company and the would you X in an interview questions shouldn't reflect how I would treat anyone addressing their own phys/mental health issue to me in such a situation.

I talked to a psychiatrist once about taking medical leave for mental health issues with his referral. He was willing to help but warned me that I may not want to as he's seen that sort of thing follow people throughout their tech careers (word gets out even if it's confidential at work). I've been terrified of bringing mental health up anywhere that coworkers or potential employers could see ever since.

So much depends upon the organization.

Now at starutp.  Previously worked at big tech company which was actually quite good at supporting mental health issues.  Still wouldn't share with bosses/other employees though as there remains a strong negative stigma.

I currently have the best managers I've ever worked with. I don't have any issues but one of my coworkers recently did and it was handled extremely well.

Israel has public health insurance for everyone. Everyone has free mental health coverage and it's quite good. So that explains some of my answers.

Stigma is the worst. People first language is a small step but we can't get that right.
