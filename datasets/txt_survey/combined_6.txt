I work for an extremely supportive company and we are amazingly open about mental health issues. Employees often share their struggles with the whole team and receive a high level of support in return.

I bring up my depression in interviews solely because I have a large gap on my CV due to mental health issues which could be mistaken for a gap taken to say have children which I feel would harm my chances much more. I have other MH issues I would never bring up with employers or peers.

I'm not aware of anyone with mental health issues at work it's definitely not something that's discussed publicly. There's also a lot of other personal info I don't know about my coworkers so it may just be that we tend not to talk about personal issues.

I suffer from mild depression and anxiety.

The family history question needs a don't know option.

I'm afraid I haven't seen mental health issues arise at work yet. They are very accommodating with maternity leave but I don't know how that translates to anything else.

Most employers / coworkers and even immediate family is not all the time supportive to discuss depression and other problems. ie. My wife thinks she should be able to make sure that I am not depressed  which is funny because sometimes depression state has nothing to do with her.

It has come to interfere with work as life progresses.Between burn out and enduring more of the work and balancing a family. Changes in my mental health have a larger pond to make ripples in.
