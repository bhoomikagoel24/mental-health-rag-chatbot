The supposed divide between mental and physical health needs to done away with and probably will be as our knowledge of the brain increases. That said we are often employed for our ability to provide value. If any issue prevents is from providing value that creates a very real challenge for the employer who is responsible to shareholders and other team members who are providing value. There are no easy answers here.

Because I'm self-employed and the only person in my organization I would have liked a not applicable option. I don't want my answers to be misleading.

I work for a very small firm that doesn't really have a dedicated H/R person. Also for the question:If you have a mental health condition do you feel that it interferes with your work?...I don't have a diagnosed mental health condition but I suspect I might have some slight depression issues. Definitely have Imposter Syndrome.

I went through a divorce and was pretty depressed I went to therapy and my boss (one of the owners) was extremely supportive. I'm not sure I would have got through that rough time with out my co-workers and boss.

I'm diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder. My benefits for mental health exist but are terrible. The deductible is $800. I see a therapist once or twice a month at the cost of $150. The insurance company only values it at $40. My psychiatrist is $180 for 15 minutes. The insurance company values it at $80. It is IMPOSSIBLE to hit my deductible. I don't even bother making the claims.

Majority of qs on survey not relevant if you are self employed

I mostly suffer from social anxiety which keeps me from attending conferences. In my small dev group a big problem is a supervisor who's a workaholic and will never say no when asked to do something so he's doing the job of at least two ppl (poorly) and working crazy hours setting the tone for the test of us that work/life balance isn't important.

I don't have any mental health issues but for a number of years I had to care for a family member who did and I felt that I was not able to discuss or get support from friends or colleagues in the same way that I might have if they had suffered from a physical condition.

I am a contractor so my lack of knowledge of workplace wellness stems directly from my lack of access to that material since I am not covered by it. I am aware that mental health services are available and am aware of a colleague who has taken a leave of absence to deal with mental health issues but am otherwise uninformed.
