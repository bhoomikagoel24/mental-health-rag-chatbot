We had a developer suffer from depression and pretty hard burnout but he refused treatment even when the company said we'd foot the bill. Eventually he had to be asked to resign which was a shame. I don't know if we have any specific programs for mental health but we're definitely on the lookout for those types of issues.

I am a 15 year vet of the industry and I get 2 weeks of combined sick and vacation time a year and I have children to fit into that too. I've had heart problems from the stress. Fuck everything about startup culture.

Italians are somewhat behind for what concerns mental health care in the workplace.  Physical health care is very much accepted with a doctor that certifies your ailment.  Mental health is treated quite differently I believe because most people are willing to admit that physical ailments should be covered while mental ailments are almost considered non-existent in most respects.

Since I am the CEO of my startup some of the would you feel comfortable and do you know the policy questions are interesting.  Of course I feel comfortable since no one can fire me and I know the policies because I chose them!However now I am curious if my employees know just how supportive the company would be of their mental health needs and this survey is making me realize that we probably haven't done a great job communicating that to everyone.  Thanks for doing this.

I work for the state so the health plan is large and cumbersome.  I believe it covers most medical as a state benefit but I haven't seen any promotion of it.  And it's not really the same as a tech company where I am.  We are an IT department but hardly run like any tech company around.

I have Narcolepsy and have been fired from a job before for falling asleep standing up during a meeting. I was standing up in the back of the room so that i could pace and try to prevent myself from falling asleep. I still managed to fall asleep while standing and fell over against the wall. I was fired the next day. The worst part is this is a condition i had given months of notice about to my boss and i reminded her of it before the meeting. I worked at a hospital at the time. I would have thought that they would be more accommodating.

I feel like most of my answers were useless due to answering that I am self-employed early on. Since my employer is me... my employer does/doesn't offer mental health benefits or would I be comfortable bring it up with 'them' doesn't make sense...

My current work situation was constructed in part because of my mental health issues. One of the reasons I'm self employed is to give me the most flexibility for coping with my mental health issues.I have been removed from a client project in the past because of a mental health condition. This was while I was an employee for a large consulting company.

Some of these questions are not really suitable for non US people.

I work for the state government. While things are slowly changing regarding covering mental health with state employees it's just not something that is acceptable in this kind of strict environment so I have to be careful about what I say and how I say it. I often take mental health days but have to call in with a physical illness because mental health problems are not acceptable excuses for using sick leave.

Thank you for your work what you do is important!

It might be safe to talk about it where I am now but I don't know for sure and I err on the side of being over cautious. Struggle with depression and anxiety which sometimes affects my productivity but I try to make up / cover up for it instead of being open about it.
