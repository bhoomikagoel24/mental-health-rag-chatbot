I'm comfortable talking about mental health with my current supervisor & my immediate at my current job but this is a first for me!

None of us who are already in marginal groups in tech--the non-young the non-male the non-white--will risk our careers to admit another source of stigma: poor health.

I have been incredibly public about my own struggle in my own conversations and in social media insofar as how I can use my depression to raise awareness or help others. Because of that my employer - or any future employer - kind of knows by default. It's not a secret. That said the downside of that openness is that I have no faith that I wouldn't be discriminated against at a future job simply because the information is public. Likewise I worry I'm seen as less-than by my employer in some circumstances. Regerdless I don't regret being public and raising awareness. My point is that even those of us who do publicly discuss the issue fear systemic retribution.

At a previous employer I witness a bad thing happen to a coworker with mental health issues get swept under the rug... :(

While not personally affected I do have immediate family with mental health illness and my employer has been very supportive. Thanks for doing this survey.

The company I work for was started by engineers and so anything other then the engineering department has always lacked a bit. Now that we've grown things are better but I feel that overall our total benefits package (including healthcare) isn't well communicated. This reflects negatively on the mental health questions above but would also reflect negatively on any other sort of survey about the benefits. That is I don't think the company is purposefully doing less for mental health. They just aren't doing enough across the board and that includes mental health.

Thank you for all you are doing to study this topic and raise awareness in our communities.

The main reason for the openness answers are because of an experience with my last employer. I felt I could trust my direct supervisor so I divulged information. It ended up spreading to more supervisors and eventually my coworkers. Supers highly suggested treatment but rushed things that shouldn't have been rushed and I ended up being incorrectly treated in a psych ward and mentally scarred from the issue. I lost most of my desire to program due to the experience not to mention thousands of dollars I lost - lost work time vacation time they used for treatment time doctors expenses etc. I have major depressive disorder high anxiety and mild agoraphobia. After seeing what treatment has to offer I will likely not seek it again and continue as is. (Long story short.)

(yes but the situation was unusual and involved a change in leadership at a very high level in the organization as well as an extended leave of absence)

I would add that while there were negative consequences for coworkers with mental health they were given a HUGE amount of leeway.  I think the team at large tried their best to be kind but that's how the person suffered.  The company actually gave this person a lot of help.  Which was cool.  But the team still discriminated.

Bipolar spectrum is tricky.

To be self employed helps but also brings you in touch with lots of new people that you might have to explain yourself to.

A lot of these answers aren't really applicable since I'm self employed as a sole proprietor.
